<h2><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>NOTE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Issue, first published in
1904, is founded on the Third Edition, corrected, published by H.
Herringman in 1668.</p>
<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>TO THE
READERS GENTLE AND SIMPLE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Preface is merely for
fashion-sake, to fill a space, and please the stationer, who says
&rsquo;tis neither usual nor handsome, to leap immediately from
the title-page to the matter.&nbsp; So that, in short, a Preface
ye have, together with the reason of it, both under one: but as
to the ordinary mode and pretence of prefaces, the translator
desires to be excused.&nbsp; For he makes a conscience of a lie,
and it were a damned one, to tell ye, that he has published this,
either to gratify the importunity of friends, or to oblige the
public, or for any other reason of a <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>hundred, that are commonly given in
excuse of scribbling.&nbsp; Not but that he loves his friends, as
well as any man, and has taken their opinion along with
him.&nbsp; Nor, but that he loves the public too (as many a man
does a coy mistress that has made his heart ache.)&nbsp; But to
pass from what had no effect upon him in this publication, to
that which overruled him in it.&nbsp; It was pure spite.&nbsp;
For he has had hard measure among the physicians, the lawyers,
the women, etc.&nbsp; And Dom Francisco de Quevedo, in English,
revenges him upon all his enemies.&nbsp; For it is a satire, that
taxes corruption of manners, in all sorts and degrees of people,
without reflecting upon particular states or persons.&nbsp; It is
full of sharpness and morality; and has found so good
entertainment in the world, that it wanted only English of being
baptized into all Christian languages.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE
FIRST VISION OF THE ALGOUAZIL (OR CATCHPOLE) POSSESSED</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Going</span> t&rsquo;other day to hear
mass at a convent in this town, the door it seems was shut, and a
world of people pressing and begging to get in.&nbsp; Upon
enquiry what the matter was; they told me of a demoniac to be
exorcised; (or dispossessed) which made me put in for one, to see
the ceremony: though to little purpose; for when I had half
smothered myself in the throng, I was e&rsquo;en glad to get out
again, and bethink myself of my lodging.&nbsp; Upon my way
homeward, at the street&rsquo;s end, it was my fortune to meet a
familiar friend of mine of the same convent; who told me over
again what I had heard before, and taking notice of my curiosity,
bade me follow him; which I did, till with his
<i>passe-partout</i> he brought me through a little back-door
into the church, and so into the vestry: where <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>we saw a
wretched kind of a dog-looked fellow with a tippet about his
neck, as ill ordered as you&rsquo;d wish; his clothes all in
tatters, his hands bound behind him, roaring and tearing after a
most hideous manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; quoth I,
crossing myself, &ldquo;what spectacle have we here?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the good Father who was to do the feat,
&ldquo;is a man that&rsquo;s possessed with an evil
spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a damned lie,&rdquo;
with respect of the company, cried the devil that tormented him,
&ldquo;for this is not a man possessed with a devil, but a devil
possessed with a man; and therefore you should do well to have a
care what you say, for it is most evident, both by the question
and answer, that you are but a company of sots.&nbsp; You are to
understand that we devils never enter into the body of a
catchpole, but by force, and in spite of our hearts; and
therefore to speak properly, you are to say, this is a devil
catchpoled, and not a catchpole bedevilled.&nbsp; And, to give
you your due, you men can deal better with us devils, than with
the catchpoles, for we fly from the cross, whereas they make use
of it, for a cloak for their villainy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But though we differ thus in our humours, we hold a
very fair correspondence in our offices: if we draw men into <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>judgment and
condemnation, so do the catchpoles; we pray for an increase of
wickedness in the world, so do they; nay and more zealously than
we, for it is their livelihood, and we do it only for company:
and in this the catchpoles are worse than the devils; they prey
upon their own kind, and worry one another.&nbsp; For our parts,
we are angels still, though black ones, and were turned into
devils only for aspiring into an equality with our Maker: whereas
the very corruption of mankind is the generation of a
catchpole.&nbsp; So that, my good Father, your labour is but lost
in plying this wretch with relics; for you may as soon redeem a
soul from hell, as a prey out of his clutches.&nbsp; In fine,
your algouazils (or catchpoles) and your devils are both of an
order, only your catchpole-devils wear shoes and stockings, and
we go barefoot after the fashion of this reverend Father; and (to
deal plainly) have a very hard time on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not a little surprised to find the devil so great a
sophister, but all this notwithstanding, the holy man went on
with his exorcism, and to stop the spirit&rsquo;s mouth, washed
his face with a little holy water, which made the demoniac ten
times madder than before, and set him a yelping <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>so horribly,
that it deafened the company, and made the very ground under us
to tremble.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you may,
perchance, imagine this extravagance to be the effect of your
holy water; but let me tell you, that mere water itself would
have done the same thing; for your catchpole hates nothing in
this world like water [especially that of a Gray&rsquo;s Inn
pump].&nbsp; But to conclude, they are so reprobated a sort of
Christians, that they have quitted even the very name of misins,
by which they were formerly known, for that of algouazils; the
latter being of Pagan extraction, and more suitable to their
manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; says the Father, &ldquo;there is no
ear, nor credit to be given to this villain; set but his tongue
at liberty, and you shall have him fall foul upon the Government,
and the ministers of justice, for keeping the world in order and
suppressing wickedness, because it spoils his
market.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No more chopping of logic good Mr.
Conjurer,&rdquo; says the devil, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s more
in&rsquo;t than you are aware of; but if you&rsquo;ll do a poor
devil a good office, give me my dispatch out of this accursed
algouazil; for I am a devil, you must know, of reputation and
quality, and shall <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>never be able to endure the gibes and affronts will be
put upon me at my return to hell, for having kept this rascal
company.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; said the
Father, &ldquo;thou shalt have thy discharge; that is to say, in
pity to this miserable creature, and not for thy own sake.&nbsp;
But tell me now, what makes thee torment him thus?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing in the world,&rdquo; quoth the devil, &ldquo;but a
contest betwixt him and me, which was the greater devil of the
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conjurer did not at all relish these wild and malicious
replies; but to me the dialogue was extreme pleasant, especially
being by this time a little familiarized with the devil.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Upon which confidence, my good Father,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;here are none but friends; and I may speak to you as my
confessor, and the confidant of all the secrets of my soul; I
have a great mind, with your leave, to ask the devil a few
questions, and who knows but a man may be the better for his
answers, though perchance contrary to his intention! keep him
only in the interim from tormenting this poor
creature.&rdquo;&nbsp; The conjurer granted my request, and the
spirit went on with his babble.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he
smiling, &ldquo;the devil shall never want a friend at court, so
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>long as
there&rsquo;s a poet within the walls.&nbsp; And indeed the poets
do us many a good turn, both by pimping and otherwise; but if
you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;should not be kind to us,&rdquo;
looking upon me, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be thought very ungrateful,
considering the honour of your entertainment now in
hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked him then what store of poets they
had?&nbsp; &ldquo;Whole swarms,&rdquo; says the devil; &ldquo;so
many, that we have been forced to make more room for them: nor is
there anything in nature so pleasant as a poet in the first year
of his probation; he comes ye laden forsooth, with letters of
recommendation to our superiors, and enquires very gravely for
Charon, Cerberus, Rhadamanthus, &AElig;acus, Minos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s their
punishment?&rdquo; (for I began now to make the poets&rsquo; case
my own).&nbsp; &ldquo;Their punishments,&rdquo; quoth the devil,
&ldquo;are many, and suited to the trade they drive.&nbsp; Some
are condemned to hear other men&rsquo;s works: (and this is the
plague of the fiddlers too) we have others that are in for a
thousand year, and yet still poring upon some old stanzas they
have made of jealousy.&nbsp; Some again are beating their
foreheads with the palms of their hands, and even boring their
very noses with hot irons, in rage that they <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>cannot come to
a resolution, whether they shall say face or visage; whether they
shall write jail or gaol; whether cony or cunny, because it comes
from <i>cuniculus</i>, a rabbit.&nbsp; Others are biting their
nails to the quick, and at their wits&rsquo; end for a rime to
chimney; and dozing up and down in a brown study, till they drop
into some hole at last, and give us trouble enough to get them
out again.&nbsp; But they that suffer the most, and fare the
worst, are your comic poets, for whoring so many queens and
princesses upon the stage, and coupling ladies of honour with
lackeys, and noblemen with common strumpets, in the winding up of
their plays; and for giving the bastinado to Alexander and Julius
C&aelig;sar in their interludes and farces.&nbsp; Now be it known
to you, that we do not lodge these with other poets, but with
pettifoggers and attorneys, as common dealers in the mystery of
shifting, shuffling, forging, and cheating: and now for the
discipline of hell, you are to understand we have incomparable
harbingers and quartermasters; insomuch that let them come in
whole caravans, as it happened t&rsquo;other day, every man is in
his quarter before you can say what&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There came to us several tradesmen; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the first of
them a poor rogue that made profession of drawing the long bow;
and him we were about to put among the armourers, but one of the
company moved and carried it, that since he was so good at
draughts, he might be sent to the clerks and scriveners; a sort
of people that will fit you with draughts, good and bad, of all
sorts and sizes, and to all purposes.&nbsp; Another called
himself a cutter, we asked him whether in wood or stone?&nbsp;
&lsquo;Neither,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but in cloth and
stuff&rsquo; (<i>Anglic&egrave;</i> a tailor); and him we turned
over to those that were in for detraction and calumny, and for
cutting large thongs out of other men&rsquo;s leather.&nbsp;
There was a blind fellow would fain have been among the poets,
but (for likeness&rsquo; sake) we quartered him among the
lovers.&nbsp; After him, came a sexton, or (as he styled himself)
a burier of the dead; and then a cook that was troubled in
conscience for putting off cats for hares: These were dispatched
away to the pastry-men.&nbsp; A matter of half a dozen
crack-brained fools we disposed of among the astrologers and
alchymists.&nbsp; In the number, there was one notorious
murderer, and him we packed away to the gentlemen of the faculty,
the physicians.&nbsp; The broken merchants we kennelled with
Judas for <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>making ill bargains.&nbsp; Corrupt ministers and
magistrates, with the thief on the left hand.&nbsp; The
embroilers of affairs, and the water-bearers take up with the
vintners; and the brokers with the Jews.&nbsp; Upon the whole
matter, the policy of hell is admirable, where every man has his
place according to his condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I remember,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you were speaking
e&rsquo;en now concerning lovers.&nbsp; Pray tell me, have you
many of them in your dominions?&nbsp; I ask, because I am myself
a little subject to the itch of love, as well as
poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; says the devil,
&ldquo;is like a great spot of oil, that diffuses itself
everywhere, and consequently hell cannot but be sufficiently
stocked with that sort of vermin.&nbsp; But let me tell you now,
we have several sorts of lovers; some dote upon themselves;
others upon their pelf; these upon their own discourses; those
upon their own actions; and once in an age perchance, comes a
fellow that dotes upon his own wife; but this is very rare, for
the jades commonly bring their husbands to repentance, and then
the devil may throw his cap at them.&nbsp; But above all, for
sport (if there can be any in hell) commend me to those gaudy
monsieurs, who by the variety of colours and ribands <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>they wear
(favours as they call them) one would swear, were only dressed up
for a sample, or kind of inventory of all the gewgaws that are to
be had for love or money at the mercers.&nbsp; Others you shall
have so overcharged with perruque, that you&rsquo;ll hardly know
the head of a cavalier from the ordinary block of a tire-woman:
and some again you&rsquo;d take for carriers, by their packets
and bundles of love-letters; which being made combustible by the
fire and flame they treat of, we are so thrifty, as to employ
upon the singeing of their own tails, for the saving of better
fuel.&nbsp; But, oh! the pleasant postures of the maiden-lover,
when he is upon the practice of the gentle-leer, and embracing
the air for his mistress!&nbsp; Others we have that are condemned
for feeling and yet never come to the touch: these pass for a
kind of buffoon pretenders; ever upon the vigil, but never arrive
at the festival.&nbsp; Some again have lost themselves with Judas
for a kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One story lower is the abode of contented cuckolds; a
nasty poisonous place, and strewed all over with the horns of
rams and bulls, etc.&nbsp; Now these are so well read in woman,
and know their destiny so well beforehand, that they never so
much as trouble their heads for the matter.&nbsp; Ye <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>come next to
the admirers of old women; and these are wretches of so depraved
an appetite, that if they were not kept tied up, and in chains,
they&rsquo;d horse the very devils themselves, and put Barabbas
to his trumps, to defend his buttocks: for the truth is, whatever
you may think of a devil, he passes with them for a very Adonis
or Narcissus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for your curiosity; a word now for your
instruction.&nbsp; If you would make an interest in hell, you
must give over that roguy way ye have got of abusing the devils
in your shows, pictures, and emblems: one while forsooth we are
painted with claws, or talons, like eagles, or griffons.&nbsp;
Another while we are dressed up with tails, like so many
hackney-jades with their fly-flaps: and now and then ye shall see
a devil with a coxcomb.&nbsp; Now I will not deny, but some of us
may indeed be very well taken for hermits, and
philosophers.&nbsp; If you can help us in this point, do; and we
shall be ready to do ye one good turn for another.&nbsp; I was
asking Michael Angelo here a while ago, why he drew the devils in
his great piece of the Last Judgment, with so many monkey faces,
and jack-pudding postures.&nbsp; His answer was, that he followed
his fancy, <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>without any malice in the world, for as then, he had
never seen any devils; nor (indeed) did he believe that there
were any; but he has now learned the contrary to his cost.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s another thing too we take extremely ill, which is,
that in your ordinary discourses, ye are out with your purse
presently to every rascal, and calling of him devil.&nbsp; As for
example.&nbsp; Do you see how this devil of a tailor has spoiled
my suit? how the devil has made me wait? how this devil has
cozened me, etc., which is very ill done, and no small
disparagement to our quality, to be ranked with tailors: a
company of slaves, that serve us in hell only for brush-wood; and
they are fain to beg hard to be admitted at all: though I confess
they have possession on their sides, and custom, which is another
law.&nbsp; Being in possession of theft, and stolen goods; they
make much more conscience of keeping your stuffs, than your holy
days, grumbling and domineering at every turn, if they have not
the same respect with the children of the family.&nbsp; Ye have
another trick, too, of giving everything to the devil, that
displeases ye, which we cannot but take very unkindly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The devil take thee,&rsquo; says one: a goodly present I
warrant ye; but the devil has <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>somewhat else to do, than to take and
carry away all that&rsquo;s given him; if they&rsquo;ll come of
themselves, let them come and welcome.&nbsp; Another gives that
whelp of a lackey to the devil; but the devil will none of your
lackeys, he thanks ye for your love; a pack of rogues that are
commonly worse than devils, and to say the truth, they are good
neither roast nor sodden.&nbsp; &lsquo;I give that Italian to the
devil,&rsquo; cries a third; thank you for nothing: for ye shall
have an Italian will choose the devil himself, and take him by
the nose like mustard.&nbsp; Some again will be giving a Spaniard
to the devil; but he has been so cruel where-ever he has got
footing, that we had rather have his room than his company, and
make a present to the grand-signior of his nutmegs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the devil stopped, and in the same instant, there
happening a slight scuffle, betwixt a couple of conceited
coxcombs, which should go foremost: I turned to see the matter,
and cast my eye upon a certain tax-gatherer, that had undone a
friend of mine: and in some sort to revenge myself of this ass in
a lion&rsquo;s skin, I asked the devil, whether they had not of
that sort of blood-suckers among the rest, in their dominions (an
informing, projecting generation <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of men, and the very bane of a
kingdom).&nbsp; &ldquo;You know little,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if
you do not know these vermin to be the right heirs of perdition,
and that they claim hell for their inheritance: and yet we are
now e&rsquo;en upon the point of discarding them, for they are so
pragmatical, and ungrateful, there&rsquo;s no enduring of
them.&nbsp; They are at this present in consultation about an
impost upon the highway to hell; and indeed payments run so high
already, and are so likely to increase too, that &rsquo;tis much
feared in the end, we shall quite lose our trading and
commerce.&nbsp; But if ever they come to put this in execution,
we shall be so bold, as to treat them next bout, to the tune of
&lsquo;Fortune my foe,&rsquo; etc. and make them cool their heels
on the wrong side of the door, which will be worse than hell to
them, for it leaves them no retreat, being expelled paradise, and
purgatory already.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This race of
vipers,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will never be quiet, till they tax
the way to heaven itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; quoth
the devil, &ldquo;that had been done long since, if they had
found the play worth the candles: but they have had a factor
abroad now these half-score years, that&rsquo;s glad to wipe his
nose on his sleeve still, for want of a
handkerchief.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But these new impositions, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>upon what I
pray ye do they intend to levy them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For
that,&rdquo; quoth the devil, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a gentleman of
the trade at your elbow can tell you all;&rdquo; pointing to my
old friend the publican.&nbsp; This drew the eyes of the whole
company upon him, and put him so damnedly out of countenance,
that he plucked down his hat over his face, clapped his tail
between his legs, and went his way; with which we were all of us
well enough pleased, and then the devil went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the devil, and laughed, &ldquo;my
voucher is departed ye see; but I think I can say as much to this
point as himself; the impositions now to be set on foot, are upon
bare-necked ladies, patches, mole-skins, Spanish-paper, and all
the <i>mundus muliebris</i> more than what is necessary and
decent; upon your <i>tour &agrave; la mode</i>, and spring garden
coaches; excess in apparel, collations, rich furniture, your
cheating, and blaspheming gaming ordinaries, and, in general,
upon whatsoever serves to advance our empire; so that without a
friend at court, or some good magistrate to help us out at a dead
lift, and stick to us, we may e&rsquo;en put up our pipes, and
you&rsquo;ll find hell a very desert.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and methinks I see nothing in
all this, but what is very reasonable; <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>for to what end serves it but to
corrupt good manners, stir up ill appetites, provoke and
encourage all sorts of debauchery, destroy all that is good and
honourable in humane society, and chalk out in effect the ready
way to the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said something e&rsquo;en now of magistrates, I
hope,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there are no judges in
hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You may as well imagine,&rdquo; cried
the spirit, &ldquo;that there are no devils there; for let me
tell you (friend mine) your corrupt judges are the great spawners
that supply our lake; for what are those millions of catchpoles,
proctors, attorneys, clerks, barristers, that come sailing to us
every day in shoals, but the fry of such judges!&nbsp; Nay
sometimes, in a lucky year, for cheating, forging, and
forswearing, we can hardly find cask to put them in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From hence now,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;would you infer,
that there&rsquo;s no justice upon the face of the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very right,&rdquo; quoth the devil,
&ldquo;for Astr&aelig;a (which is the same thing) is fled long
since to heaven.&nbsp; Do not ye know the story?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; quoth the
devil, &ldquo;mind me and I&rsquo;ll tell ye it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time Truth and Justice came together to
take up their quarters <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>upon the earth: but the one being
naked, and the other very severe and plain-dealing, they could
not meet with anybody that would receive them.&nbsp; At last,
when they had wandered a long time like vagabonds in the open
air, Truth was glad to take up her lodging with a mute; and
Justice, perceiving that though her name was much used for a
cloak to knavery, yet that she herself was in no esteem, took up
a resolution of returning to heaven: and in order to her journey,
she bade adieu in the first place to all courts, palaces, and
great cities, and went into the country, where she met with some
few poor simple cottagers, that gave her entertainment; but
malice and persecution found her out in the end, and she was
banished thence too.&nbsp; She presented herself in many places,
and people asked her what she was?&nbsp; She answered them,
&lsquo;Justice,&rsquo; for she would not lie for the
matter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Justice?&rsquo; cried they, &lsquo;she is a
stranger to us; tell her here&rsquo;s nothing for her,&rsquo; and
shut the door.&nbsp; Upon these repulses, she took wing, and away
she went to heaven, hardly leaving so much as the bare print of
her footsteps behind her.&nbsp; Her name however is not yet
forgotten, and she&rsquo;s pictured with a sceptre in her hand,
and is still called Justice; but call her what ye <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>will, she
makes as good a fire in hell as a tailor; and for sleight of
hand, puts down all the gilts, cheats, picklocks, and trepanners
in the world: to say the truth, avarice is grown to that height,
that men employ all the faculties of soul and body to rob and
deceive.&nbsp; The lecher, does not he steal away the honour of
his mistress? (though with her consent).&nbsp; The attorney picks
your pocket, and shows you a law for&rsquo;t; the comedian gets
your money and your time, with reciting other men&rsquo;s
labours; the lover cozens you with his eyes; the eloquent, with
his tongue; the valiant, with his arm; the musician, with his
voice and fingers; the astrologer, with his calculations; the
apothecary, with sickness and health; the surgeon, with blood;
and the physician, with death itself; and in some sort or other,
they are all cheats; but the catchpole (in the name of justice)
abuses you with his whole man; he watches you with his eyes;
follows you with his feet; seizes with his hands; accuses with
his tongue; and in fine, put it in your litany, from catchpoles,
as well as devils, <i>libera nos domine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how comes it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you have
not coupled the women with the thieves? for they are both of a
trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Not a word of women as ye love me,&rdquo; quoth
the devil, &ldquo;for we are so tired out with their
importunities; so deafened with the eternal clack of their
tongues, that we start at the very thought of them.&nbsp; And to
say the truth, hell were no ill winter quarter, if it were not so
overstocked with that sort of cattle.&nbsp; Since the death of
the Witch of Endor, it has been all their business to improve
themselves in subtlety and malice, and to set us together by the
ears among ourselves.&nbsp; Nay some of them are confident
enough, to tell us to our teeth, that when we have done our
worst, they&rsquo;ll give us a Rowland for our Oliver.&nbsp; Only
this comfort we have, that they are a cheaper plague to us, than
they are to you; for we have no Exchanges, Hyde Parks, or Spring
Gardens in our territories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are well stored then with women, I see, but of
which have you most?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;handsome, or
ill-favoured?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, of the ill-favoured, six
for one,&rdquo; quoth the devil, &ldquo;for your beauties can
never want gallants to lay their appetites; and many of them,
when they come at last to have their bellies full, e&rsquo;en
give over the sport, repent and &rsquo;scape.&nbsp; Whereas
nobody will touch the ill-favoured without a pair of tongs; and
for want of water to quench <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>their fire, they come to us such
skeletons, that they are enough to affright the devil
himself.&nbsp; For they are most commonly, old, and accompany
their last groans with a curse upon the younger that are to
survive them.&nbsp; I carried away one t&rsquo;other day of
threescore and ten, that I took just in the nick, as she was upon
a certain exercise to remove obstructions: and when I came to
land her, alas for the poor woman! what a terrible fit had she
got of the toothache! when upon search, the devil a tooth had she
left in her head, only she belied her chops to save her
credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have exceedingly satisfied me,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;in all your answers; but pray&rsquo;e once again, what
store of beggars have ye in hell?&nbsp; Poor people I
mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor,&rdquo; quoth the devil,
&ldquo;who are they?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Those,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;that have no possessions in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can that be,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;that those should
be damned, that have nothing in the world? when men are only
damned for cleaving to&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And briefly I find none of
their names in our books, which is no wonder, for he that has
nothing to trust to, shall be left by the devil himself in time
of need.&nbsp; To deal plainly with you, where have you greater
devils than your flatterers, false friends, <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>lewd company,
envious persons, than a son, a brother, or a relation, that lies
in wait for your life to get your fortune, that mourns over you
in your sickness, and wishes you already at the devil.&nbsp; Now
the poor have none of this; they are neither flattered, nor
envied, nor befriended, nor accompanied: there&rsquo;s no gaping
for their possessions; and in short, they are a sort of people
that live well, and die better; and there are some of them, that
would not exchange their rags for royalty itself: they are at
liberty to go and come at pleasure, be it war or peace; free from
cares, taxes, and public duties.&nbsp; They fear no judgments or
executions, but live as inviolable as if their persons were
sacred.&nbsp; Moreover they take no thoughts for tomorrow, but
setting a just value on their hours, they are good husbands of
the present; considering that what is past, is as good as dead,
and what&rsquo;s to come, uncertain.&nbsp; But they say,
&lsquo;When the devil preaches, the world&rsquo;s near an
end.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Divine Hand is in this,&rdquo; said the holy man
that performed the exorcism, &ldquo;thou art the father of lies,
and yet deliverest truths able to mollify and convert a heart of
stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But do not you mistake
yourself,&rdquo; quoth the devil, &ldquo;to <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>suppose that
your conversion is my business; for I speak these truths to
aggravate your guilt, and that you may not plead ignorance
another day, when you shall be called to answer for your
transgressions.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, most of you shed tears at
parting, but &rsquo;tis the apprehension of death, and no true
repentance for your sins that works upon you: for ye are all a
pack of hypocrites: or if at any time you entertain those
reflections, your trouble is, that your body will not hold out;
and then forsooth ye pretend to pick a quarrel with the sin
itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art an impostor,&rdquo; said the
religious, &ldquo;for there are many righteous souls, that draw
their sorrow from another fountain.&nbsp; But I perceive you have
a mind to amuse us, and make us lose time, and perchance your own
hour is not yet come to quit the body of this miserable creature;
however, I conjure thee in the name of the Most High to leave
tormenting him, and to hold thy peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The devil
obeyed; and the good Father applying himself to us, &ldquo;My
masters,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;though I am absolutely of opinion
that it is the devil that has talked to us all this while through
the organ of this unhappy wretch, yet he that well weighs what
has been said, may doubtless reap some benefit by the
discourse.&nbsp; <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Wherefore without considering whence it came; remember,
that Saul (although a wicked prince) prophesied; and that honey
has been drawn out of the mouth of a lion.&nbsp; Withdraw then,
and I shall make it my prayer (as &rsquo;tis my hope) that this
sad and prodigious spectacle may lead you to a true sight of your
errors, and, in the end, to amendment of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">THE END OF THE FIRST VISION</p>
<h2><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>THE
SECOND VISION OF DEATH AND HER EMPIRE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mean</span> souls do naturally breed sad
thoughts, and in solitude, they gather together in troops to
assault the unfortunate; which is the trial (according to my
observation) wherein the coward does most betray himself; and yet
cannot I for my life, when I am alone, avoid those accidents and
surprises in myself, which I condemn in others.&nbsp; I have
sometime, upon reading the grave and severe Lucretius, been
seized with a strange damp; whether from the striking of his
counsels upon my passions, or some tacit reflection of shame upon
myself, I know not.&nbsp; However, to render this confession of
my weakness the more excusable, I&rsquo;ll begin my discourse
with somewhat out of that elegant and excellent poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the case,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that a voice from
heaven should speak to any of us after this manner; what dost
thou ail, O mortal <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>man, or to what purpose is it, to spend thy life in
groans, and complaints under the apprehension of death? where are
thy past tears and pleasures?&nbsp; Are they not vanished and
lost in the flux of time, as if thou hadst put water into a
sieve?&nbsp; Bethink thyself then of a retreat, and leave the
world with the same content, and satisfaction, as thou wouldst do
a plentiful table, and a jolly company upon a full stomach.&nbsp;
Poor fool that thou art! thus to macerate and torment thyself,
when thou may&rsquo;st enjoy thy heart at ease, and possess thy
soul with repose and comfort, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This passage brought into my mind the words of Job, cap. 14,
and I was carried on from one meditation to another, till at
length, I fell fast asleep over my book, which I ascribed rather
to a favourable providence, than to my natural disposition.&nbsp;
So soon as my soul felt herself at liberty, she gave me the
entertainment of this following comedy, my fancy supplying both
the stage and the company.</p>
<p>In the first scene, entered a troop of physicians, upon their
mules, with deep foot-cloths, marching in no very good order,
sometime fast, sometime slow, and to say the truth, most commonly
in a huddle.&nbsp; They were all wrinkled and <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>withered
about the eyes; I suppose with casting so many sour looks upon
the piss-pots and close-stools of their patients, bearded like
goats; and their faces so over-grown with hair, that their
fingers could hardly find the way to their mouths.&nbsp; In the
left hand they held their reins, and their gloves rolled up
together; and in the right, a staff <i>&agrave; la mode</i>,
which they carried rather for countenance, than correction; (for
they understood no other menage than the heel) and all along,
head and body went too, like a baker upon his panniers.&nbsp;
Divers of them, I observed, had huge gold rings upon their
fingers, and set with stones of so large a size, that they could
hardly feel a patient&rsquo;s pulse, without minding him of his
monument.&nbsp; There were more than a good many of them, and a
world of puny practisers at their heels, that came out graduates,
by conversing rather with the mules than the doctors: well! said
I to myself, if there goes no more than this to the making a
physician, it is no marvel we pay so dear for their
experience.</p>
<p>After these, followed a long train of mountebank-apothecaries,
laden with pestles, and mortars, suppositories, spatulas,
glister-pipes and syringes, ready charged, and as mortal as
gun-shot, and several <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>titled boxes with remedies without,
and poisons within: ye may observe that when a patient comes to
die, the apothecary&rsquo;s mortar rings the passing-bell, as the
priest&rsquo;s requiem finishes the business.&nbsp; An
apothecary&rsquo;s shop is (in effect) no other than the
physician&rsquo;s armoury, that supplies him with weapons; and
(to say the truth) the instruments of the apothecary and the
soldier are much of a quality: what are their boxes but petards?
their syringes, pistols; and their pills, but bullets?&nbsp; And
after all, considering their purgative medicines, we may properly
enough call their shops purgatory; and why not their persons
hell? their patients the damned? and their masters the
devils?&nbsp; These apothecaries were in jackets, wrought all
over with Rs, struck through like wounded hearts, and in the form
of the first character of their prescriptions, which (as they
tell us) signifies <i>recipe</i> (take thou) but we find it to
stand for <i>recipio</i> (I take.)&nbsp; Next to this figure,
they write ana, ana, which is as much as to say an ass, an ass;
and after this, march the ounces and the scruples; an
incomparable cordial to a dying man; the former to dispatch the
body, and the latter, to put the soul into the highway to the
devil.&nbsp; To hear them call over their <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>simples,
would make you swear they were raising so many devils.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s your opopanax, buphthalmus, astaphylinos,
alectorolophos, ophioscorodon, anemosphorus, etc.</p>
<p>And by all this formidable bombast, is meant nothing in the
world but a few paltry roots, as carrots, turnips, skirrets,
radish and the like.&nbsp; But they have the old proverb at their
fingers&rsquo; end: &ldquo;he that knows thee will never buy
thee;&rdquo; and therefore everything must be made a mystery, to
hold their patients in ignorance, and keep up the price of the
market.&nbsp; And were not the very names of their medicines
sufficient to fright away any distemper, &rsquo;tis to be feared
the remedy would prove worse than the disease.&nbsp; Can any pain
in nature, think ye, have the confidence to look a physician in
the face, that comes armed with a drug made of man&rsquo;s
grease? though disguised under the name of mummy, to take off the
horror and disgust of it: or to stay for a dressing with Dr.
Whachum&rsquo;s plaster, that shall fetch up a man&rsquo;s leg to
the size of a mill-post?&nbsp; When I saw these people herded
with the physicians, methought the old sluttish proverb, that
says, &ldquo;there is a great distance between the pulse and the
arse,&rdquo; was much to blame for making such a difference in
their dignities, <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>for I find none at all; but the physician skips in a
trice from the pulse to the stool and urinal, according to the
doctrine of Galen, who sends all his disciples to those unsavoury
oracles, from whose hands the devil himself, if he were sick,
would not receive so much as a glister.&nbsp; Oh! these cursed
and lawless arbitrators and disposers of our lives! that without
either conscience or religion, divide our souls and bodies, by
their damned poisonous potions, scarifications, incisions,
excessive bleedings, etc., which are but the several ways of
executing their tyranny and injustice upon us.</p>
<p>In the tail of these, came the surgeons, laden with pincers,
cranes-bills, catheters, desquamatories, dilaters, scissors,
saws; and with them so horrid an outcry, of cut, tear, open, saw,
flay, burn, that my bones were ready to creep one into another
for fear of an operation.</p>
<p>The next that came in, I should have taken by their mien, for
devils disguised, if I had not spied their chains of rotten
teeth, which put me in some hope they might be tooth-drawers, and
so they proved; which is yet one of the lewdest trades in the
world; for they are good for nothing but to depopulate our
mouths, and <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>make us old before our time.&nbsp; Let a man but yawn,
and ye shall have one of these rogues examining his grinders, and
there&rsquo;s not a sound tooth in your head, but he had rather
see&rsquo;t at his girdle, than in the place of its nativity:
nay, rather than fail, he&rsquo;ll pick a quarrel with your
gums.&nbsp; But that which puts me out of all patience, is to see
these scoundrels ask twice as much for drawing an old tooth as
would have bought ye a new one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;we are now
past the worst, unless the devil himself come next.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And in that instant I heard the brushing of guitars, and the
rattling of citterns, raking over certain <i>passacailles</i> and
sarabands.&nbsp; These are a kennel of barbers thought I, or
I&rsquo;ll be hanged; and any man that had ever seen a
barber&rsquo;s shop might have told you as much without a
conjurer, both by the music and by the very instruments, which
are as proper a part of a barber&rsquo;s furniture as his
comb-cases and wash-balls.&nbsp; It was to me a pleasant
entertainment, to see them lathering of asses&rsquo; heads, of
all sorts and sizes, and their customers all the while winking
and sputtering over their basins.</p>
<p>Presently after these, appeared a consort of loud and tedious
talkers, that tired and <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>deafened the company with their
shrill, and restless gaggle; but as one told me, these were of
several sorts.&nbsp; Some they called swimmers from the motion of
their arms in all their discourses, which was just as if they had
been paddling.&nbsp; Others they called apes (and we mimics);
these were perpetually making of mops, and mows, and a thousand
antic ridiculous gestures, in derision and imitation of
others.&nbsp; In the third place, were make-bates, and sowers of
dissension, and these were still rolling their eyes (like a
Bartlemey puppet, without so much as moving the head) and leering
over their shoulders, to surprise people at unawares in their
familiarities, and privacies, and gather matter for calumny and
detraction.&nbsp; The liars followed next; and these seemed to be
a jolly contented sort of people, well fed, and well clothed; and
having nothing else to trust to, methought it was a strange trade
to live upon.&nbsp; I need not tell you, that they are never
without a full audience, since all fools and impertinents are of
their congregation.</p>
<p>After these, came a company of meddlers, a pragmatical
insolent generation of men that will have an oar in every boat,
and are indeed the bane of honest conversation, and the troublers
of all companies and <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>affairs, the most prostitute of all
flatterers, and only devoted to their own profit.&nbsp; I thought
this had been the last scene, because no more came upon the stage
for a good while; and indeed I wondered that they came so late
themselves, but one of the babblers told me (unasked) that this
kind of serpent carrying his venom in his tail; it seemed
reasonable, that being the most poisonous of the whole gang, they
should bring up the rear.</p>
<p>I began then to take into thought, what might be the meaning
of this oglio of people of several conditions and humours met
together; but I was quickly diverted from that consideration by
the apparition of a creature which looked as if &rsquo;twere of
the feminine gender.&nbsp; It was a person, of a thin and slender
make, laden with crowns, garlands, sceptres, scythes,
sheep-hooks, pattens, hobnailed shoes, tiaras, straw hats,
mitres, Monmouth caps, embroideries, skins, silk, wool, gold,
lead, diamonds, shells, pearl, and pebbles.&nbsp; She was dressed
up in all the colours of the rainbow; she had one eye shut, the
other open; young on the one side, and old o&rsquo; the
other.&nbsp; I thought at first, she had been a great way off,
when indeed she was very near me, and when I took her to be at my
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>chamber
door, she was at my bed&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; How to unriddle this
mystery I knew not; nor was it possible for me to make out the
meaning of an equipage so extravagant, and so fantastically put
together.&nbsp; It gave me no affright, however, but on the
contrary I could not forbear laughing, for it came just then into
my mind that I had formerly seen in Italy a farce, where the
mimic, pretending to come from the other world, was just thus
accoutred, and never was anything more nonsensically
pleasant.&nbsp; I held as long as I could, and at last, I asked
what she was.&nbsp; She answered me, &ldquo;I am
Death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Death! (the very word brought my heart into
my mouth) &ldquo;and I beseech you, madam,&rdquo; quoth I (with
great humility and respect) &ldquo;whither is your honour a
going?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No further,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;for now I have found you, I am at my journey&rsquo;s
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas, alas! and must I die then,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; quoth Death, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ll take thee quick along with me; for since so many of
the dead have been to visit the living, it is but equal for once,
that one of the living should return a visit to the dead.&nbsp;
Get up then and come along; and never hang an arse for the
matter; for what you will not do willingly, you shall do in spite
of your teeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; This put me in a cold fit; <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>but without
more delay up I started, and desired leave only to put on my
breeches.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;no matter
for clothes, nobody wears them upon this road; wherefore come
away, naked as you are, and you&rsquo;ll travel the
better.&rdquo;&nbsp; So up I got, without a word more and
followed her, in such a terror, and amazement, that I was but in
an ill condition to take a strict account of my passage; yet I
remember, that upon the way, I told her: &ldquo;Madam, under
correction, you are no more like the Deaths that I have seen,
than an apple&rsquo;s like an oyster.&nbsp; Our Death is pictured
with a scythe in her hand; and a carcass of bones, as clean as if
the crows had picked it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo;
said she, turning short upon me, &ldquo;I know that very well;
but in the meantime your designers and painters are but a company
of buzzards.&nbsp; The bones you talk of are the dead, or
otherwise the miserable remainders of the living; but let me tell
you that you yourselves are your own death, and that which you
call death, is but the period of your life, as the first moment
of your birth is the beginning of your death; and effectually, ye
die living, and your bones are no more than what death has left
and committed to the grave.&nbsp; If this were rightly
understood, every man <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>would find a <i>memento mori</i>, or
a death&rsquo;s head, in his own looking-glass; and consider
every house with a family in&rsquo;t but as a sepulchre filled
with dead bodies; a truth which you little dream of, though
within your daily view and experience.&nbsp; Can you imagine a
death elsewhere, and not in yourselves?&nbsp; Believe&rsquo;t
y&rsquo;are in a shameful mistake; for you yourselves are
skeletons before ye are aware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, madam, under favour, what may all these people be
that keep your ladyship company? and since you are Death (as you
say) how comes it, that the babblers, and make-bates, are nearer
your person, and more in your good graces than the
physicians?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says she,
&ldquo;there are more people talked to death and dispatched by
babblers, than by all the pestilential diseases in the
world.&nbsp; And then your make-bates, and meddlers kill more
than your physicians, though (to give the gentlemen of the
faculty their due) they labour night and day for the enlargement
of our empire.&nbsp; For you must understand, that though
distempered humours make a man sick, &rsquo;tis the physician
kills him; and looks to be well paid for&rsquo;t too: (and
&rsquo;tis fit that every man should live by his trade) so that
when a man is asked, what such <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>or such a one died of, he is not
presently to make answer, that he died of a fever, pleurisy, the
plague, purples, or the like; but that he died of the
doctor.&nbsp; In one point, however, I must needs acquit the
physician; ye know that the style of right honourable, and right
worshipful, which was heretofore appropriate only to persons of
eminent degree and quality, is now in our days used by all sorts
of little people; nay the very barefoot friars, that live under
vows of humility and mortification, are stung with this itch of
title and vainglory.&nbsp; And your ordinary tradesmen, as
vintners, tailors, masons, and the like, must be all dressed up
forsooth in the right worshipful: whereas your physician does not
so much court honour of appellation (though, if it should rain
dignities, he might be persuaded happily to venture the wetting)
but sits down contentedly with the honour of disposing of your
lives and moneys, without troubling himself about any other sort
of reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entertainment of these lectures, and discourses made the
way seem short and pleasant, and we were just now entering into a
place, betwixt light and dark, and of horror enough, if Death and
I had not by this time been very well acquainted.&nbsp; Upon <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>one side of
the passage, I saw three moving figures, armed, and of human
shape, and so alike, that I could not say which was which.&nbsp;
Just opposite, on the other side, a hideous monster, and these
three to one, and one to three, in a fierce, and obstinate
combat.&nbsp; Here Death made a stop, and facing about, asked me
if I knew these people.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! no,&rdquo; quoth I,
&ldquo;Heaven be praised, I do not, and I shall put it in my
litany that I never may.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now to see thy
ignorance,&rdquo; cried Death; &ldquo;these are thy old
acquaintance, and thou hast hardly kept any other company since
thou wert born.&nbsp; Those three are the world, the flesh, and
the devil, the capital enemies of thy soul; and they are so like
one another, as well in quality, as appearance, that effectually,
whoever has one, has all.&nbsp; The proud and ambitious man
thinks he has got the world, but it proves the devil.&nbsp; The
lecher, and the epicure, persuade themselves that they have
gotten the flesh, and that&rsquo;s the devil too; and in fine,
thus it fares with all other kinds of extravagants.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s he there,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that
appears in so many several shapes? and fights against the other
three?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; quoth Death, &ldquo;is
the devil of money, who maintains that he himself alone is
equivalent to them three, <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and that wherever he comes,
there&rsquo;s no need of them.&nbsp; Against the world, he argues
from their own confession and experience: for it passes for an
oracle, that there&rsquo;s no world but money; he that&rsquo;s
out of money&rsquo;s out of the world.&nbsp; Take away a
man&rsquo;s money, and take away his life.&nbsp; Money answers
all things.&nbsp; Against the second enemy, he pleads that money
is the flesh too: witness the girls and the ganymedes it
procures, and maintains.&nbsp; And against the third, he urges
that there&rsquo;s nothing to be done without this devil of
money.&nbsp; Love does much but money does all; and money will
make the pot boil, though the devil piss in the
fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So that for ought I see,&rdquo; quoth
I, &ldquo;the devil of money has the better end of the
staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this, advancing a little further, I saw on one hand
judgment, and hell on the other (for so Death called them).&nbsp;
Upon the sight of hell, making a stop, to take a stricter survey
of it, Death asked me, what it was I looked at.&nbsp; I told her,
it was hell; and I was the more intent upon it, because I thought
I had seen it somewhere else before.&nbsp; She questioned me,
where?&nbsp; I told her, that I had seen it in the corruption and
avarice of wicked magistrates; in the pride and haughtiness of
grandees; in <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>the appetites of the voluptuous; in the lewd designs of
ruin and revenge; in the souls of oppressors; and in the vanity
of divers princes.&nbsp; But he that would see it whole and
entire, in one subject, must go to the hypocrite, who is a kind
of religious broker, and puts out at five-and-forty per cent. the
very Sacraments and Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad too,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I have
seen judgment as I find it here, in its purity; for that which we
call judgment in the world is a mere mockery: if it were like
this, men would live otherwise than they do.&nbsp; To conclude:
if it be expected that our judges should govern themselves and us
by this judgment, the world&rsquo;s in an ill case; for
there&rsquo;s but little of&rsquo;t there.&nbsp; And to deal
plainly, as matters are, I have no great maw to go home again:
for &rsquo;tis better being with the dead, where there&rsquo;s
justice, than with the living, where there&rsquo;s
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our next step was into a fair and spacious plain, encompassed
with a huge wall, where he that&rsquo;s once in must never look
to come out again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop here,&rdquo; quoth Death,
&ldquo;for we are now come to my judgment-seat, and here it is
that I give audience.&rdquo;&nbsp; The walls were hung with sighs
and groans, <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>ill-news, fears, doubts, and surprises.&nbsp; Tears did
not there avail either the lover or the beggar; but grief and
care were without both measure and comfort; and served as vermin
to gnaw the hearts of emperors and princes, feeding upon the
insolent and ambitious, as their proper nourishment.&nbsp; I saw
Envy there dressed up in a widow&rsquo;s veil, and the very
picture of the government of one of your noblemen&rsquo;s
houses.&nbsp; She kept a continual fast as to the shambles,
preying only upon herself; and could not but be a very slender
gentlewoman, upon so spare a diet.&nbsp; Nothing came amiss to
her teeth (good or bad) which made the whole set of them yellow
and rotten, and the reason was that, though she bit, and set her
mark upon the good and the sound, she could never swallow
it.&nbsp; Under her, sat discord; the legitimate issue of her own
bowels.&nbsp; She had formerly conversed much with married
people, but finding no need of her there, away she went to
colleges and corporations, where it seems they had more already
than they knew what to do withal; and then she betook herself to
courts and palaces, and officiated there, as the devil&rsquo;s
lieutenant.&nbsp; Next to her was ingratitude, and she out of a
certain paste made up of pride and malice, <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>was moulding
of new devils.&nbsp; I was extreme glad of this discovery, being
of opinion, till now, that the ungrateful had been the devils
themselves, because I read, that the angels that fell were made
devils for their ingratitude.&nbsp; To be short, the whole place
echoed with rage and curses.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a devil have we
here to do,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;does it rain curses in this
country?&rdquo;&nbsp; With that; a death at my elbow asked me,
what a devil could I expect else, in a place where there were so
many matchmakers, attorneys, and common barristers, who are a
pack of the most accursed wretches in nature.&nbsp; Is there
anything more common in the world, than the exclamations of
husbands and wives?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! that damned devil of a
pander: a heavy curse upon that bitch of a bawd that ever brought
us together.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The pillory and ten thousand
gibbets to boot take that pickpocket attorney, that advised me to
this lawsuit; h&rsquo; as ruined me for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But pray&rsquo;e,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what do all these
matchmakers and attorneys here together?&nbsp; Do they come for
audience?&rdquo;&nbsp; Death was here a little quick upon me, and
called me fool for so impertinent a question.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
there were no matchmakers,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we should not
have the tenth part of these <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>skeletons, and desperadoes.&nbsp; Am
not I here the fifth husband of a woman yet living in the world,
that hopes to send twice as many more after me, and drink maudlin
at the fifteenth funeral?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You say
well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as to the business of matchmakers;
but why so many pettifoggers, I pray&rsquo;e?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay, then, I perceive,&rdquo; quoth Death, &ldquo;now you
have a mind to seize me; for that rascally sort of caterpillars
have been my undoing.&nbsp; Had not a man better die by the
common hangman than by the hand of an attorney? to be killed by
falsities, quirks, cavils, delays, exceptions, cheats,
circumventions: yes, yes, and it must not be denied, that these
makers of matches, and splitters of causes, are the principal
support of this imperial throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, I raised my eyes, and saw Death seated in her
chair of state, with abundance of little deaths crowding about
her: as the death of love, of cold, hunger, fear, and laughter;
all, with their several ensigns and devices.&nbsp; The death of
love, I perceived, had very little brain, and to keep herself in
countenance, she kept company with Pyramus and Thisbe, Hero and
Leander, and some Amadis&rsquo;s and Palmerins d&rsquo;Oliva; all
embalmed, steeped in good vinegar, and well dried.&nbsp; I saw a
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>great many
other sorts of lovers too, that were brought, in all appearance,
to their last agonies, but by the singular miracle of
self-interest recovered to the tune of</p>
<blockquote><p>Will, if looking well won&rsquo;t move her,<br />
Looking ill prevail?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The death of cold was attended by a many prelates, bishops,
abbots, and other ecclesiastics, who had neither wives, nor
children, nor indeed anybody else that cared for them, further
than for their fortunes.&nbsp; These, when they come to a fit of
sickness, are pillaged even to their sheets and bedding, before
ye can say a paternoster.&nbsp; Nay, many times they are
stripped, ere they are laid, and destroyed for want of clothes to
keep them warm.</p>
<p>The death of hunger was encompassed with a multitude of
avaricious misers that were cording up of trunks, bolting of
doors and windows, locking up of cellars and garrets, and nailing
down of trap doors, burying of pots of money, and starting at
every breath of wind they heard.&nbsp; Their eyes were ready to
drop out of their heads, for want of sleep; their mouths and
bellies complaining of their hands, and their souls turned into
gold and silver (the idols they adored.)</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>The
death of fear had the most magnificent train and attendance of
all the rest, being accompanied with a great number of usurpers
arid tyrants, who commonly do justice upon themselves, for the
injuries they have done to others, their own consciences doing
the office of tormentors, and avenging their public crimes by
their private sufferings; for they live in a perpetual anguish of
thought, with fears and jealousies.</p>
<p>The death of laughter was the last of all, and surrounded with
a throng of people, hasty to believe, and slow to repent, living
without fear of justice, and dying without hope of mercy.&nbsp;
These are they that pay all their debts and duties with a
jest.&nbsp; Bid any of them, &ldquo;Give every man his due, and
return what he has either borrowed, or wrongfully taken,&rdquo;
his answer is, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a man die with
laughing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tell him, &ldquo;My friend, you are now in
years, your dancing days are done, and your body is worn out;
what should such a scarecrow as you are do with a
bed-fellow?&nbsp; Give over your bawdy haunts for shame, and
don&rsquo;t make a glory of a sin, when you&rsquo;re past the
pleasure of it, and yourself upon all accounts contemptible into
the bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This fellow,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;would make a man <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>break his heart with
laughing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, come, say your prayers, and
bethink yourself of eternity; you have one foot in the grave
already, and &rsquo;tis high time to fit yourself for the other
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou wilt absolutely kill me with
laughing.&nbsp; I tell thee I&rsquo;m as sound as a rock, and I
do not remember that ever I was better in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Others there are, that, let a man advise them upon their
deathbeds and even at the last gasp to send for a divine, or to
make some handsome settlement of their estates, &ldquo;Alas,
alas!&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll cry; &ldquo;I have been as bad as this
many a time before, and (with Falstaffe&rsquo;s hostess) I hope
in the Lord there&rsquo;s no need to think of him
yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; These men are lost for ever, before they can be
brought to understand their danger.&nbsp; This vision wrought
strangely upon me, and gave me all the pains and marks imaginable
of a true repentance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;since so it is, that man has but one life allotted him and
so many deaths; but one way into the world and so many millions
out of it, I will certainly at my return make it more my care
than it has been to live with a good conscience, that I may die
with comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words were scarce out of my mouth, when the crier
of the court with a <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>loud voice called out, &ldquo;The dead, the dead; appear
the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so immediately, I saw the earth begin
to move, and gently opening itself, to make way, first for heads
and arms, and then by degrees for the whole bodies of men and
women, that came out, half muffled in their nightcaps, and ranged
themselves in excellent order, and with a profound silence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says Death, &ldquo;let everyone speak in his
turn;&rdquo; and in the instant, up comes one of the dead to my
very beard, with so much fury and menace, in his face and action,
that I would have given him half the teeth in my head for a
composition.&nbsp; &ldquo;These devils of the world,&rdquo; quoth
he, &ldquo;what would they be at? my masters, cannot a poor
wretch be quiet in his grave for ye? but ye must be casting your
scorns upon him, and charging him with things that upon my soul
he&rsquo;s as innocent of as the child that&rsquo;s unborn.&nbsp;
What hurt has he done any of you (ye scoundrels you) to be thus
abused?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And I beseech you, sir,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;(under your favourable correction) who may you be? for
I confess I have not the honour either to know or to understand
ye.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;the
unfortunate Tony, that has been in his grave now this many a fair
year, and yet your wise worships <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>forsooth have not wit enough to make
yourselves and your company merry, but Tony must still be
one-half of your entertainment and discourse.&nbsp; When any man
plays the fool or the extravagant, presently he&rsquo;s a
Tony.&nbsp; Who drew this or that ridiculous piece?&nbsp;
Tony.&nbsp; Such or such a one was never well taught: no, he had
a Tony to his master.&nbsp; But let me tell ye, he that shall
call your wisdoms to shrift and take a strict account of your
words and actions, will upon the upshot find you all a company of
Tonys, and in effect the greater impertinents.&nbsp; As for
instance: did I ever make ridiculous wills (as you do) to oblige
others to pray for a man in his grave, that never prayed for
himself in his life?&nbsp; Did I ever rebel against my
superiors?&nbsp; Or, was I ever so arrant a coxcomb, as by
colouring my cheeks and hair, to imagine that I could reform
nature, and make myself young again?&nbsp; Can ye say that I ever
put an oath to a lie? or broke a solemn promise, as you do every
day that goes over your heads?&nbsp; Did I ever enslave myself to
money?&nbsp; Or, on the other side, make ducks and drakes with
it? and squander it away in gaming, revelling, and whoring?&nbsp;
Did my wife ever wear the breeches?&nbsp; Or, did I ever marry <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>at all, to be
revenged of a false mistress?&nbsp; Was I ever so very a fool as
to believe any man would be true to me, who had betrayed his
friend?&nbsp; Or, to venture all my hopes upon the wheel of
fortune?&nbsp; Did I ever envy the felicity of a court-life, that
sells and spends all for a glance?&nbsp; What pleasure did I ever
take in the lewd discourses of heretics and libertines?&nbsp; Or,
did I ever list myself in the party, to get the name of a gifted
brother?&nbsp; Who ever saw me insolent to my inferiors, or
basely servile to my betters?&nbsp; Did I ever go to a conjurer,
or to your dealers in nativities, and horoscopes upon any
occasion of loss or death?&nbsp; Now if you yourselves be guilty
of all these fopperies, and I innocent, I beseech ye
where&rsquo;s the Tony?&nbsp; So that you see Tony is not the
Tony you take him for.&nbsp; But (to crown his other virtues) he
is also endued with so large a stock of patience that whoever
needed it had it for the asking, unless it were such as came to
borrow money; or in cases of women, that claimed marriage of him;
or lackeys that would be making sport with his bauble; and to
these, he was as resolute as John Florio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While we were upon this discourse, another of the dead came
marching up to <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>me, with a Spanish pace and gravity; and giving me a
touch o&rsquo; the elbow, &ldquo;Look me in the face,&rdquo;
quoth he with a stern countenance, &ldquo;and know, sir, that you
are not now to have to do with a Tony.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
beseech your lordship,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;(saving your
reverence) let me know your honour, that I may pay my respects
accordingly; for I must confess, I thought all people here had
been, hail fellow well met.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
called,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;by mortals, Queen Dick; and
whether you know me or not, I&rsquo;m sure you think and talk of
me often enough; and if the devil did not possess ye, you would
let the dead alone, and content yourselves to persecute one
another.&nbsp; Ye can&rsquo;t see a high crowned hat, a
threadbare cloak, a basket-hilt sword, or a dudgeon dagger, nay
not so much as a reverend matron, well stricken in years, but
presently ye cry, &ldquo;This or that&rsquo;s of the mode or date
of Queen Dick.&rdquo;&nbsp; If ye were not every mother&rsquo;s
child of ye stark mad, ye would confess that Queen Dick&rsquo;s
were golden days to those ye have had since, and &rsquo;tis an
easy matter to prove what I say.&nbsp; Will ye see a mother now
teaching her daughter a lesson of good government?&nbsp;
&lsquo;Child,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;you know that modesty is
the great ornament of your sex; wherefore <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>be sure, when
ye come in company, that you don&rsquo;t stand staring the men in
the face, as if ye were looking babies in their eyes, but rather
look a little downward, as a fashion of behaviour more suitable
to the obligations of your sex.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Downward?&rsquo; says the girl, &lsquo;I beseech you,
madam, excuse me: this was well enough in the days of Queen Dick,
when the poor creatures knew no better.&nbsp; Let the men look
downward towards the clay of which they were made, but man was
our original, and it will become us to keep our eyes upon the
matter from whence we came.&rsquo;&nbsp; If a father give his son
in charge, to worship his Creator, to say his prayers morning and
evening, to give thanks before and after meat, to have a care of
gaming and swearing, ye shall have the son make answer, that
&rsquo;tis true, this was practised in the time of Queen Dick,
but it is now quite out of mode; and in plain English, men are
better known nowadays by their atheism and blasphemy than by
their beards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon, Queen Dick withdrew, and then appeared a large
glass-bottle, wherein was luted up (as I heard) a famous
necromancer, hacked and minced according to his own order, to
render him immortal.&nbsp; <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>It was boiling upon a quick fire, and
the flesh by little and little began to piece again, and made
first an arm, then a thigh, after that a leg; and at last there
was an entire body, that raised itself upright in the
bottle.&nbsp; Bless me (thought I!) what&rsquo;s here?&nbsp; A
man made of a pottage, and brought into the world out of the
belly of a bottle?&nbsp; This vision affrighted me to the very
heart; and while I was yet panting and trembling, a voice was
heard out of the glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;In what year of our Lord are
we?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;1636,&rdquo; quoth I.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
welcome,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for &rsquo;tis the happy year I
have longed for so many a day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is it, I
pray&rsquo;e,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;that I now see and hear in
the belly of this bottle?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;the great necromancer of Europe; and certainly you
cannot but have heard both of my operations in general, and of
this particular design.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard talk of
you from a child,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;but all those stories I
took only for old wives&rsquo; fables.&nbsp; You are the man then
it seems: I must confess that at first, at a distance I took this
bottle for the vessel that the ingenious Rabelais makes mention
of; but coming near enough to see what was in it, I did then
imagine it might be some philosopher <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>by the fire, or some apothecary doing
penance for his errors.&nbsp; In fine, it has cost me many a
heavy step to come hither, and yet to see so great a rarity I
cannot but think my time and pains very well
bestowed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The necromancer called to me then to
unstop the bottle, and as I was breaking the clay to open it,
&ldquo;Hold, hold a little,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;and I prithee
tell me first how go squares in Spain?&nbsp; What money?&nbsp;
Force?&nbsp; Credit?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The plate fleets go and
come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;reasonably well; but the foreigners
that come in for their snips have half spoiled the trade.&nbsp;
The Genoeses run out as far as the mountains of Potosi, and have
almost drained them dry.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My child,&rdquo;
quoth he, &ldquo;that trade can never be secure and open, so long
as Spain has any enemy that&rsquo;s potent at sea.&nbsp; And for
the Genoeses, they&rsquo;ll tell you this is no injustice at all,
but on the contrary, a new way of quitting old scores, and
justifying his Catholic Majesty for a good paymaster.&nbsp; I am
no enemy to that nation, but upon the account of their vices and
encroachments; and I confess, rather than see these rascals
prosper, I&rsquo;d turn myself into a <i>bouillon</i> again, as
ye saw me just now; nay, I did not care if &rsquo;twere into a
powder, though I <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>ended my days in a tobacco-box.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;comfort yourself, for these people are
as miserable as you&rsquo;d wish them.&nbsp; You know they are
cavaliers and signiors already, and now (forsooth) they have an
itch upon them to be princes: a vanity that gnaws them like a
cancer; and by drawing on great expenses, breeds a worm in their
traffic, so that you&rsquo;ll find little but debt and
extravagance at the foot of the accompt.&nbsp; And then the
devil&rsquo;s in them for a wench, insomuch, that &rsquo;tis
well, if they bring both ends together; for what&rsquo;s gotten
upon the &rsquo;Change is spent in the stews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is well,&rdquo; quoth the necromancer, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m glad to hear it.&nbsp; Pray&rsquo;e tell me now, what
price bears honour and honesty in the world?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s much to be said,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;upon
that point; but in brief, there was never more of it in talk, nor
less in effect.&nbsp; &lsquo;Upon my honesty,&rsquo; cries the
tradesman; &lsquo;Upon my honour,&rsquo; says his lordship.&nbsp;
And in a word, every man has it, and every thing is it, in some
disguise or other; but duly considered, there&rsquo;s no such
thing upon the face of the earth.&nbsp; The thief says &rsquo;tis
more honourable to take than beg.&nbsp; He that asks an alms,
pleads that &rsquo;tis honester to beg <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>than steal.&nbsp; Nay the false
witnesses and murderers themselves stand upon their points, as
well as their neighbours, and will tell ye that a man of honour
will rather be buried alive than submit (though they will not
always do as they say).&nbsp; Upon the whole matter, every man
sets up a court of honour within himself, pronounces everything
honourable that serves his purpose, and laughs at them that think
otherwise.&nbsp; To say the truth, all things are now
topsy-turvy.&nbsp; A good faculty in lying is a fair step to
preferment; and to pack a game at cards, or help the frail die,
is become the mark and glory of a cavalier.&nbsp; The Spaniards
were heretofore, I confess, a very brave, and well governed
people; but they have evil tongues among them nowadays, that say
they might e&rsquo;en go to school to the Indians to learn
sobriety and virtue.&nbsp; For they are not really sober, but at
their own tables, which indeed is rather avarice than moderation;
for when they eat or drink at another man&rsquo;s cost, there are
no greater gluttons in the world; and for fuddling, they shall
make the best pot-companion in Switzerland knock under the
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The necromancer went on with his <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>discourse, and asked me what store of
lawyers and attorneys in Spain at present.&nbsp; I told him, that
the whole world swarmed with them, and that there were of several
sorts: some, by profession; others, by intrusion and presumption;
and some again by study, but not many of the last, though indeed
sufficient of every kind to make the people pray for the Egyptian
locusts and caterpillars in exchange for that vermin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; quoth the necromancer, &ldquo;if there be
such plagues abroad, I think I had best e&rsquo;en keep where I
am.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is with justice,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;as with sick men; in time past, when we had fewer doctors
(as well of law as of physic) we had more right, and more health:
but we are now destroyed by multitudes, and consultations, which
serve to no other end than to inflame both the distemper and the
reckoning.&nbsp; Justice, as well as truth, went naked, in the
days of old; one single book of laws and ordinances, was enough
for the best ordered Government in the world.&nbsp; But the
justice of our age is tricked up with bills, parchments, writs,
and labels; and furnished with millions of codes, digests,
pandects, pleadings, and reports; and what&rsquo;s their use, but
to make wrangling <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>a science? and to embroil us in seditions, suits, and
endless trouble and confusion.&nbsp; We have had more books
published this last twenty years than in a thousand before, and
there hardly passes a term without a new author, in four or five
volumes at least under the titles of glosses, commentaries,
cases, judgments, etc.&nbsp; And the great strife is, who writes
most, not best; so that the whole bulk is but a body without a
soul, and fitter for a churchyard than a study.&nbsp; To say the
truth, these lawyers and solicitors are but so many
smoke-merchants, sellers of wind, and troublers of the public
peace.&nbsp; If there were no attorneys, there would be no suits;
if no suits, no cheats, no serjeants; no catchpoles, no prisons;
if no prisons, no judges; no judges, no passion; no passion, no
bribery or subornation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See now what a train of mischiefs one wretched
pettifogger draws after him!&nbsp; If you go to him for counsel,
he hears your story, reads your case, and tells you very gravely:
&lsquo;Sir, this is a nice point, and would be well handled;
we&rsquo;ll see what the law says.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he runs
ye over with his eye and finger a matter of a hundred volumes,
grumbling all the while, like a <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>cat that claws in her play
&rsquo;twixt jest and earnest.&nbsp; At last, down comes the
book, he shows the law, bids ye leave your papers, and
he&rsquo;ll study the question.&nbsp; &lsquo;But your cause is
very good,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;by what I see already, and if
you&rsquo;ll come again in the evening, or to-morrow morning,
I&rsquo;ll tell ye more.&nbsp; But pardon me, sir, now I think
on&rsquo;t, I am retained upon the business of the Fens, it
cannot be till Monday next, and then I&rsquo;m for
ye.&rsquo;&nbsp; When ye are to part, and that you come to the
greasing of his fist (the best thing in the world both for the
wit, and memory), &lsquo;Good Lord! sir,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;what do you mean!&nbsp; I beseech you, sir; nay,
pray&rsquo;e sir,&rsquo; and if he spies you drawing back, the
paw opens, seizes the guineas, and good-morrow
countryman.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sayst thou me so?&rdquo; quoth
the good fellow in the glass, &ldquo;stop me up close again as
thou lovest me then: for the very air of these rascals will
poison me, if ever I put my head out of this bottle, till the
whole race of them be extinct.&nbsp; In the meantime, take this
for a rule: he that would thrive by law, must fee his
enemies&rsquo; counsel as well as his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now ye talk of great cheats; what news of the
Venetians?&nbsp; Is Venice still <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>in the world or no?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the world do ye say?&nbsp; Yes, marry
is&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and stands just where it
did.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;I
prithee give it to the devil from me as a token of my love; for
&rsquo;tis a present equal to the severest revenge.&nbsp; Nothing
can ever destroy that Republic but conscience; and then
you&rsquo;ll say &rsquo;tis like to be long-lived; for if every
man had his own, it would not be left worth a groat.&nbsp; To
speak freely, &rsquo;tis an odd kind of common-wealth.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the very arse-gut, the drain and sink of monarchies,
both in war and peace.&nbsp; It helps the Turk to vex the
Christians, and the Christians to gall the Turk, and maintains
itself to torment both.&nbsp; The inhabitants are neither Moors
nor Christians, as appears by a Venetian captain, in a combat
against a Christian enemy: &lsquo;Stand to&rsquo;t my
masters,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;ye were Venetians before ye were
Christians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, enough of this,&rdquo; cried the necromancer,
&ldquo;and tell me, how stand the people affected?&nbsp; What
malcontents and mutineers?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mutiny,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;is so universal a disease that every kingdom is
(in effect) but a great hospital, or rather a Bedlam (for all men
are mad) to entertain the disaffected.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no stirring <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>for me then,&rdquo; quoth the
necromancer, &ldquo;but pray&rsquo;e commend me however to those
busy fools, and tell them, that carry what face they will,
there&rsquo;s vanity and ambition in the pad.&nbsp; Kings and
princes have their nature much of quick-silver.&nbsp; They are in
perpetual agitation, and without any repose.&nbsp; Press them too
hard (that is to say beyond the bounds of duty and reason) and
they are lost.&nbsp; Ye may observe that your guilders and great
dealers in quick-silver are generally troubled with the palsy;
and so should all subjects tremble that have to do with majesty,
and better to do it at first, out of respect, than afterward,
upon force and necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But before I fall to pieces again, as you saw me
e&rsquo;en now (for better so than worse) I beseech ye, one word
more, and it shall be my last.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s King of Spain
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that
Philip the 3rd is dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; quoth
he, &ldquo;a prince of incomparable piety, and virtue (or my
stars deceive me).&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;After him,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;came Philip the 4th.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If it be
so,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;break, break my bottle immediately,
and help me out; for I am resolved to try my fortune in the world
once again, under the reign of that glorious <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>prince.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that word, he dashed the
glass to pieces against a rock, crept out of his case and away he
ran.&nbsp; I had a good mind to have kept him company; but as I
was just about to start, &ldquo;Let him go, let him go,&rdquo;
cried one of the dead, and laid hold of my arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
has devilish heels, and you&rsquo;ll never overtake
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I stayed, and what should I see next but a wondrous old
man, whose name might have been Bucephalus by his head; and the
hair on his face might very well have stuffed a couple of
cushions: take him together, and you&rsquo;ll find his picture in
the map, among the savages.&nbsp; I need not tell ye that I
stared upon him sufficiently; and he taking notice of it, came to
me, and told me: &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;my spirit
tells me that you are now in pain to know who I am; understand
that my name is Nostradamus.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you the
author, then,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;of that gallimaufry of
prophecies that&rsquo;s published in your name?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gallimaufry say&rsquo;st thou?&nbsp; Impudent and
barbarous rascal that thou art; to despise mysteries that are
above thy reach, and to revile the secretary of the stars, and
the interpreter of the destinies; who is so <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>brutal as to
doubt the meaning of these lines?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From second causes, this I gather,<br />
Nought shall befall us, good, or ill,<br />
Either upon the land or water,<br />
But what the Great Disposer will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Reprobated and besotted villains that ye are! what
greater blessing could betide the world than the accomplishment
of this prophecy? would it not establish justice and holiness,
and suppress all the vile suggestions and motions of the
devil?&nbsp; Men would not then any longer set their hearts upon
avarice, cozening, and extortion; and make money their god, that
vagabond money, that&rsquo;s perpetually trotting up and down
like a wandering whore, and takes up most commonly with the
unworthy, leaving the philosophers and prophets, which are the
very oracles of the heavens (such as Nostradamus) to go
barefoot.&nbsp; But let&rsquo;s go on with our prophecies, and
see if they be so frivolous and dark, as the world reports
them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the married shall marry,<br />
Then the jealous will be sorry;<br />
And though fools will be talking,<br />
To keep their tongues walking;<br />
No man runs well I find,<br />
But with&rsquo;s elbows behind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>This
gave me such a fit of laughing that it made me cast my nose up
into the air, like a stone-horse that hath got a mare in the
wind: which put the astrologer out of all patience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Buffoon, and dog-whelp, as ye are,&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a bone for you to pick; you must be snarling
and snapping at everything.&nbsp; Will your teeth serve ye now to
fetch out the marrow of this prophecy?&nbsp; Hear then in the
devil&rsquo;s name, and be mannerly.&nbsp; Hear, and learn I say,
and let&rsquo;s have no more of that grinning, unless ye have a
mind to leave your beard behind ye.&nbsp; Do you imagine that all
that are married marry?&nbsp; No, not the one half of them.&nbsp;
When you are married, the priest has done his part; but after
that, to marry, is to do the duty of a husband.&nbsp; Alack! how
many married men live as if they were single; and how many
bachelors on the other side, as if they were married! after the
mode of the times.&nbsp; And wedlock to divers couples is no
other than a more sociable state of virginity.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
one half of my prophecy expounded already, now for the
rest.&nbsp; Let me see you run a little for experiment, and try
if you carry your elbows before, or behind.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
tell me perhaps, that this is ridiculous, because everybody knows
it.&nbsp; <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>A pleasant shift: as if truth were the worse for being
plain.&nbsp; The things indeed that you deliver for truths are
for the most part mere fooleries and mistakes; and it were a hard
matter to put truth in such a dress as would please ye.&nbsp;
What have ye to say now, either against my prophecy or my
argument? not a syllable I warrant ye, and yet somewhat there is
to be said, for there&rsquo;s no rule without an exception.&nbsp;
Does not the physician carry his elbow before him, when he puts
back his hand to take his patient&rsquo;s money?&nbsp; And away
he&rsquo;s gone in a trice, so soon as he has made his
purchase.&nbsp; But to proceed, here&rsquo;s another of my
prophecies for ye,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Many women shall be mothers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their babbies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their n&rsquo;own daddies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What say ye to this now? are there not many husbands do
ye think (if the truth were known) that father more children than
their own?&nbsp; Believe me, friend, a man had need have good
security upon a woman&rsquo;s belly, for children are commonly
made in the dark, and &rsquo;tis no easy matter to know the
workman, especially having nothing but the woman&rsquo;s bare
word for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; This is meant of the court of assistance;
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>and
whoever interprets my prophecies to the prejudice of any person
of honour, abuses me.&nbsp; You little think what a world of our
gay folks in their coaches and six, with lackeys at their heels
by the dozens, will be found at the last day, to be only the
bastards of some pages, gentlemen-ushers, or <i>valets de
chambre</i> of the family; nay perchance the physician may have
had his hand in the wrong box, and in case of a necessity, good
use has been made of a lusty coachman.&nbsp; Little do you think
(I say) how many noble families upon that grand discovery, will
be found extinct for want of issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am now convinced,&rdquo; said I to the mathematician,
&ldquo;of the excellency of your predictions; and I perceive
(since you have been pleased to be your own interpreter) that
they have more weight in them than we were aware of.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye shall have one more,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;and I have
done.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This year, if I&rsquo;ve any skill i&rsquo;
th&rsquo; weather,<br />
Shall many a one take wing with a feather.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say that your wit will serve ye now to imagine,
that I&rsquo;m talking of rooks and jackdaws; but I say,
No.&nbsp; I speak of lawyers, attorneys, clerks, scriveners, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and their
fellows, that with the dash of a pen can defeat their clients of
their estates, and fly away with them when they have
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon these words Nostradamus vanished, and somebody plucking
me behind, I turned my face upon the most meagre, melancholic
wretch that ever was seen, and covered all in white.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and as you
are a good Christian, do but deliver me from the persecution of
these impertinents and babblers that are now tormenting me, and
I&rsquo;ll be your slave for ever&rdquo; (casting himself at my
feet in the same moment; and crying like a child).&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what art thou,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;for a miserable
creature?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;an
ancient, and an honest man, although defamed with a thousand
reproaches and slanders: and in fine, some call me another, and
others somebody, and doubtless ye cannot but have heard of
me.&nbsp; As somebody says, cries one, that has nothing to say
for himself; and yet till this instant, I never so much as opened
my mouth.&nbsp; The Latins call me Quidam, and make good use of
me to fill up lines, and stop gaps.&nbsp; When you go back again
into the world, I pray&rsquo;e do me the favour to own that you
have seen me, and to justify me <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>for one that never did, and never
will either speak or write anything, whatever some tattling
idiots may pretend.&nbsp; When they bring me into quarrels and
brawls, I am called forsooth, a certain person; in their
intrigues, I know not who; and in the pulpit, a certain author;
and all this, to make a mystery of my name, and lay all their
fooleries at my door.&nbsp; Wherefore I beseech ye help
me;&rdquo; which I promised to do.&nbsp; And so this vision
withdrew to make place for another.</p>
<p>And that was the most frightful piece of antiquity that ever
eye beheld in the shape of an old woman.&nbsp; She came nodding
towards me, and in a hollow, rattling tone (for she spoke more
with her chops than her tongue) &ldquo;Pray&rsquo;e,&rdquo; says
she, &ldquo;is there not somebody come lately hither from the
other world?&rdquo;&nbsp; This apparition, thought I, is
undoubtedly one of the devil&rsquo;s scarecrows.&nbsp; Her eyes
were so sunk in their sockets, that they looked like a pair of
dice in the bottom of a couple of red boxes.&nbsp; Her cheeks and
the soles of her feet were of the same complexion.&nbsp; Her
mouth was pale, and open too; the better to receive the
distillations of her nose.&nbsp; Her chin was covered with a kind
of goose-down, as toothless as a lamprey; <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>and the flaps
of her cheeks were like an ape&rsquo;s bags; her head danced, and
her voice at every word kept time to&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Her body was
veiled, or rather wrapped up in a shroud of crape.&nbsp; She had
a crutch in one hand, which served her for a supporter; and a
rosary in t&rsquo;other, of such a length, that as she stood
stooping over it, a man would have thought she had been fishing
for death&rsquo;s heads.&nbsp; When I had done gaping upon this
epitome of past ages, &ldquo;Hola! grannum,&rdquo; quoth I, good
lustily in her ear, taking for granted that she was deaf,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s your pleasure with me?&rdquo;&nbsp; With that
she gave a grunt, and being much in wrath to be called grannum,
clapped a fair pair of spectacles upon her nose, and pinking
through them, &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;neither deaf,
nor grannum; but may be called by my name as well as my
neighbours,&rdquo; (giving to understand, that women will take it
ill to be called old, even in their very graves).&nbsp; As she
spake, she came still nearer me, with her eyes dropping, and the
smell about her perfectly of a dead body.&nbsp; I begged her
pardon for what was past, and for the future her name, that I
might be sure to keep myself within the bounds of respect.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am called,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;Do&uuml;egna, or
Madam <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the
Gouvernante.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; quoth
I, in a great amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have ye any of those cattle
in this country?&nbsp; Let the inhabitants pray heartily for
peace then; and all little enough to keep them quiet.&nbsp; But
to see my mistake now.&nbsp; I thought the women had died, when
they came to be gouvernantes, and that for the punishment of a
wicked world, the gouvernantes had been immortal.&nbsp; But I am
now better informed, and very glad truly to meet with a person I
have heard so much talk of.&nbsp; For with us, who but Madam the
Gouvernante, at every turn?&nbsp; &lsquo;Do ye see that mumping
hag,&rsquo; cries one?&nbsp; &lsquo;Come here ye damned
jade,&rsquo; cries another.&nbsp; &lsquo;That old bawd,&rsquo;
says a third, &lsquo;has forgotten, I warrant ye, that ever she
was a whore, and now see if we do not remember
ye.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You do so, and I&rsquo;m in your
debt for your remembrance, the great devil be your paymaster, ye
son of a whore, you; are there no more gouvernantes than
myself?&nbsp; Sure there are, and ye may have your choice,
without affronting me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;have a little patience, and at my return,
I&rsquo;ll try if I can put things in better order.&nbsp; But in
the meantime, what business have you here?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her
reverence upon this was a little qualified, and told <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>me that she
had now been eight hundred years in hell, upon a design to erect
an order of the gouvernantes; but the right worshipful the
devil-commissioners are not as yet come to any resolution upon
the point.&nbsp; For say they, if your gouvernantes should come
once to settle here, there would need no other tormentors, and we
should be but so many Jacks out of office.&nbsp; And besides, we
should be perpetually at daggers-drawing about the brands and
candle-ends which they would still be filching, and laying out of
the way; and for us to have our fuel to seek, would be very
inconvenient.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been in purgatory too,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;upon the same project, but there so soon as ever
they set eye on me, all the souls cried out unanimously,
<i>libera nos</i>, etc.&nbsp; As for heaven, that&rsquo;s no
place for quarrels, slanders, disquiets, heart-burnings, and
consequently none for me.&nbsp; The dead are none of my friends
neither, for they grumble, and bid me let them alone as they do
me; and be gone into the world again if I please, and there (they
tell me) I may play the gouvernante <i>in s&aelig;cula
s&aelig;culorum</i>.&nbsp; But truly I had rather be here at my
ease than spend my life crumpling, and brooding over a carpet at
a bed-side, like a thing of clouts, to <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>secure the poultry of the family from
strange cocks, which would now and then have a brush with a
virgin pullet, but for the care of the gouvernantes.&nbsp; And
yet &rsquo;tis she, good woman, bears all the blame, in case of
any miscarriage: the gouvernante was presently of the plot, she
had a feeling in the cause, a finger in the pie.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tis she in fine that must answer for all.&nbsp; Let but a
sock, an old handkercher, the greasy lining of a masque, or any
such frippery piece of business be missing, ask the gouvernante
for this, or for that.&nbsp; And in short, they take us certainly
for so many storks and ducks, to gather up all the filth about
the house.&nbsp; The servants look upon us as spies and
tell-tales: my cousin forsooth, and t&rsquo;other&rsquo;s aunt
dares not come to the house, for fear of the gouvernante.&nbsp;
And indeed I have made many of them cross themselves, that took
me for a ghost.&nbsp; Our masters they curse us too for
embroiling the family.&nbsp; So that I have rather chosen to take
up here, betwixt the dead and the living, than to return again to
my charge of a Do&uuml;egna, the very sound of the name being
more terrible than a gibbet.&nbsp; As appears by one that was
lately travelling from Madrid to Vailladolid, and asking where he
might lodge that night.&nbsp; Answer <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>was made at a small village called
Do&uuml;egnas.&nbsp; &lsquo;But is there no other place,&rsquo;
quoth he, &lsquo;within some reasonable distance, either short or
beyond it?&rsquo;&nbsp; They told him no, unless it were at a
gallows.&nbsp; &lsquo;That shall be my quarter then,&rsquo; quoth
he, &lsquo;for a thousand gibbets are not so bad to me as one
Do&uuml;egnas.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now ye see how we are abused,&rdquo;
quoth the gouvernante, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll do us some
right, when it lies in your power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would have talked me to death, if I had not given her the
slip upon the removing of her spectacles; but I could not
&rsquo;scape so neither, for looking about me for a guide to
carry me home again, I was arrested by one of the dead; a good
proper fellow, only he had a pair of rams&rsquo; horns on his
head, and I was about to salute him for Aries in the Zodiac; but
when I saw him plant himself, just before me, with his best leg
forward, stretching out his arms, clutching his fists, and
looking as sour as if he would have eaten me without mustard,
&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the devil is dead and
this is he.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried a bystander,
&ldquo;this is a man:&rdquo; &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s drunk, I perceive, and quarrelsome in his ale,
for here&rsquo;s <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>nobody has touched him.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that, as he
was just ready to fall on, I stood to my guard, and we were armed
at all points alike, only he had the odds of the headpiece.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, sirrah,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;have at ye, slave that
you are to make a trade of defaming persons of honour.&nbsp; By
the death that commands here, I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; my revenge,
and turn your skin over your ears.&rdquo;&nbsp; This insolent
language stirred my choler I confess, and so I called to him
&ldquo;Come, come on, sirrah; a little nearer yet, and if ye have
a mind to be twice killed, I&rsquo;ll do your business; who the
devil brought this cornuto hither to trouble me?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
word was no sooner out, but we were immediately at it, tooth and
nail, and if his horns had not been flatted to his head, I might
have had the worst on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But the whole ring presently
came in to part us, and did me a singular kindness in&rsquo;t,
for my adversary had a fork, and I had none.&nbsp; As they were
staving and tailing, &ldquo;You might have had more
manners,&rdquo; cried one, &ldquo;than to give such language to
your betters, and to call Don Diego Moreno cuckold.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And is this that Diego Moreno then?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rascal that he is to charge me with abusing persons of
honour.&nbsp; A scoundrel,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that &rsquo;tis
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>a shame
for death to be seen in&rsquo;s company, and was never fit for
anything in his whole life, but to furnish matter for a
farce.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s my grievance,
gentlemen,&rdquo; quoth Don Diego, &ldquo;for which with your
leave he shall give me satisfaction.&nbsp; I do not stand upon
the matter of being a cuckold, for there&rsquo;s many a brave
fellow lives in Cuckold&rsquo;s-Row.&nbsp; But why does he not
name others, as well as me?&nbsp; As if the horn grew upon
nobody&rsquo;s head but mine: I&rsquo;m sure there are others
that a thousand times better deserve it.&nbsp; I hope, he cannot
say that ever I gored any of my superiors; or that my being
cornuted has raised the price of post-horns, lanthorns, or
pocket-ink-horns.&nbsp; Are not shoeing-horns and knife-handles
as cheap now as ever?&nbsp; Why must I walk the stage then more
than my neighbours?&nbsp; Beyond question there never lived a
more peaceable wretch upon the face of the earth, all things
considered, than myself.&nbsp; Never was man freer from jealousy,
or more careful to step aside at the time of visit: for I was
ever against the spoiling of sport, when I could make none
myself.&nbsp; I confess I was not so charitable to the poor as I
might have been; the truth of&rsquo;t <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>is, I watched them as a cat would do
a mouse, for I did not love them.&nbsp; But then in requital, I
could have out-snorted the Seven Sleepers, when any of the better
sort came to have a word in private with my wife.&nbsp; The short
on&rsquo;t is, we agreed blessedly well together, she and I; for
I did whatever she would have me; and she would say a thousand
and a thousand times &lsquo;Long live my poor Diego, the best
conditioned, the most complaisant husband in the world; whatever
I do is well done, and he never so much as opens his mouth good
or bad.&rsquo;&nbsp; But by her leave that was little to my
credit, and the jade when she said it was beside the
cushion.&nbsp; For many and many a time have I said &lsquo;This
is well,&rsquo; and &lsquo;That&rsquo;s ill.&rsquo;&nbsp; When
there came any poets to our house, fiddlers or morrice-dancers, I
would say, &lsquo;This is not well.&rsquo;&nbsp; But when the
rich merchants came &lsquo;Oh, very good,&rsquo; would I say,
&lsquo;this is as well as well can be.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sometimes we
had the hap to be visited by some penniless courtier, or
low-country officer perchance; then should I take her aside, and
rattle her to some tune: &lsquo;Sweetheart,&rsquo; would I say,
&lsquo;pray&rsquo;e what ha&rsquo; we to do with these frippery
fellows and damme boys.&nbsp; Shake them off, I&rsquo;d advise
ye, and take this for a <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>warning.&rsquo;&nbsp; But when any
came that had to do with the mint or exchequer, and spent freely
(for lightly come, lightly go), &lsquo;I marry, my dear,&rsquo;
quoth I, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to be lost by keeping such
company.&rsquo;&nbsp; And what hurt in all this now?&nbsp; Nay,
on the contrary, my poor wife enjoyed herself happily under the
protection of my shadow, and being a <i>femme couverte</i>, not
an officer durst come near her.&nbsp; Why should then this
buffoon of a poetaster make me still the ridiculous entertainment
of all his interludes and farces, and the fool in the
play?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By your favour,&rdquo; quoth I,
&ldquo;we are not yet upon even terms; and before we part, you
shall know what &rsquo;tis to provoke a poet.&nbsp; If thou wert
but now alive, I&rsquo;d write thee to death, as Archilocus did
Lycambes.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m resolved to put the history of thy
life in a satire, as sharp as vinegar, and give it the name of
The Life and Death of Don Diego Moreno.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
shall go hard,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll prevent
that,&rdquo; and so we fell to&rsquo;t again, hand and foot, till
at length the very fancy of a scuffle waked me, and I found
myself as weary, as if it had been a real combat.&nbsp; I began
then to reflect upon the particulars of my dream, and to consider
what advantage I might draw from it: for the <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>dead are past
fooling, and those are the soundest counsels which we receive
from such as advise us without either passion or interest.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">THE END OF THE SECOND VISION</p>
<h2><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>THE
THIRD VISION OF THE LAST JUDGMENT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Homer</span> makes Jupiter the author or
inspirer of dreams; especially the dreams of princes and
governors; and if the matter of them be pious and
important.&nbsp; And it is likewise the judgment of the learned
Propertius that good dreams come from above, have their weight,
and ought not to be slighted.&nbsp; And truly I am much of his
mind, in the case of a dream I had the other night.&nbsp; As I
was reading a discourse touching the end of the world, I fell
asleep over the book, and dreamt of the last judgment.&nbsp; (A
thing which in the house of a poet is scarce admitted so much as
in a dream.)&nbsp; This fancy minded me of a passage in Claudian:
that all creatures dream at night of what they have heard and
seen in the day, as the hound dreams of hunting the hare.</p>
<p>Methought I saw a very handsome youth <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>towering in
the air, and sounding of a trumpet; but the forcing of his breath
did indeed take off much of his beauty.&nbsp; The very marbles, I
perceived, and the dead obeyed his call; for in the same moment,
the earth began to open, and set the bones at liberty, to seek
their fellows.&nbsp; The first that appeared were sword-men, as
generals of armies, captains, lieutenants, common soldiers, who
supposing that it had sounded a charge, came out of their graves,
with the same briskness and resolution, as if they had been going
to an assault or a combat.&nbsp; The misers put their heads out,
all pale and trembling, for fear of a plunder.&nbsp; The
cavaliers and good fellows believed they had been going to a
horserace, or a hunting-match.&nbsp; And in fine, though they all
heard the trumpet, there was not any creature knew the meaning of
it (for I could read their thoughts by their looks and
gestures).&nbsp; After this, there appeared a great many souls,
whereof some came up to their bodies, though with much difficulty
and horror; others stood wondering at a distance, not daring to
come near so hideous and frightful a spectacle.&nbsp; This wanted
an arm, that an eye, t&rsquo;other a head.&nbsp; Upon the whole,
though I could not but smile at the prospect <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>of so strange
a variety of figures, yet was it not without just matter of
admiration at the all-powerful Providence, to see order drawn out
of confusion, and every part restored to the right owner.&nbsp; I
dreamt myself then in a churchyard; and there, methought, divers
that were loth to appear were changing of heads; and an attorney
would have demurred upon pretence that he had got a soul was none
of his own, and that his body and soul were not fellows.</p>
<p>At length, when the whole congregation came to understand that
this was the day of judgment, it was worth the while to observe
what shifting and shuffling there was among the wicked.&nbsp; The
epicure and whoremaster would not own his eyes, nor the slanderer
his tongue, because they&rsquo;d be sure to appear in evidence
against them.&nbsp; The pickpockets ran away as hard as they
could drive from their own fingers.&nbsp; There was one that had
been embalmed in Egypt, and staying for his tripes, an old usurer
asked him, if the bags were to rise with the bodies?&nbsp; I
could have laughed at this question, but I was presently taken up
with a crowd of cutpurses, running full speed from their own ears
(that were offered them again) for fear of the sad stories they
expected to hear.&nbsp; I saw all <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>this from a convenient standing; and
in the instant, there was an outcry at my feet, &ldquo;Withdraw,
withdraw.&rdquo;&nbsp; The word was no sooner given, but down I
came, and immediately a great many handsome ladies put forth
their heads, and called me clown, for not paying them that
respect and ceremony which belonged to their quality (now you
must know that the women stand upon their pantofles, even in hell
itself).&nbsp; They seemed at first very gay and frolic; and
truly, well enough pleased to be seen naked, for they were
clean-skinned and well made.&nbsp; But when they came to
understand that this was the great day of accompt; their
consciences took check, and all the jollity was dashed in a
moment; whereupon they took to the valley, miserably listless and
out of humour.&nbsp; There was one among the rest, that had had
seven husbands, and promised every one of them never to marry
again, for she could never love anything else she was sure: this
lady was casting about for fetches, and excuses, and what answer
she should make to that point.&nbsp; Another that had been as
common as Ratcliff highway, would neither lead nor drive, and
stood humming and hawing a good while, pretending she had forgot
her night-gear, and <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>such fooleries; but spite of her heart, she was brought
at last within sight of the throne, where she found a world of
her old acquaintance that she had carried part of their way to
hell, who had no sooner set eye on her, but they fell a pointing
and hooting, so that she took up her heels and herded herself in
a troop of serjeants.&nbsp; After this, I saw a many people
driving a physician along the bank of a river, and these were
only such as he had unnecessarily dispatched before their
time.&nbsp; They followed him with cries of, &ldquo;Justice,
justice,&rdquo; and forced him on toward the judgment-seat, where
they arrived in the end with much ado.&nbsp; While this passed, I
heard, methought, upon my left hand a paddling in the water, as
if one had been swimming: and what should this be, but a judge in
the middle of a river washing and rinsing his hands, over and
over.&nbsp; I asked him the meaning of it; and he told me, that
in his lifetime he had been often daubed in the fist, to make the
business slip the better, and he would willingly get out the
grease before he came to hold up his hand at the bar.&nbsp; There
followed next a multitude of vintners and tailors, under the
guard of a legion of devils, armed with rods, whips, cudgels, and
other instruments <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>of correction: and these counterfeited themselves deaf,
and were very loth to leave their graves, for fear of a worse
lodging.&nbsp; As they were passing on, up started a little
lawyer, and asked whither they were going; they made answer, that
they were going to give an account of their works.&nbsp; With
that the lawyer threw himself flat upon his belly in his hole
again: &ldquo;If I am to go downward at last,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;I am thus much onward of my way.&rdquo;&nbsp; The vintner
sweat as he walked, till one drop followed another;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well done,&rdquo; cried a devil at&rsquo;s
elbow, &ldquo;to purge out thy water, that we may have none in
our wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a tailor wrapped up in
sarcenets, crook-fingered and baker-legged, spake not one word
all the way he went, but alas! alas! how can any man be a thief
that dies for want of bread?&nbsp; But his companions gave him a
rebuke for discrediting his trade.&nbsp; The next that appeared
were a band of highwaymen, following upon the heels one of
another, in great distrust and jealousy of thieves among
themselves.&nbsp; These were fetched up by a party of devils in
the turning of a hand and lodged with the tailors;
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; said one of the company, &ldquo;your
highwayman is but a wild tailor.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were a little
quarrelsome <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>at first, but in the conclusion, they went down into the
valley, and kennelled quietly together.&nbsp; After these came
Folly with her gang of poets, fiddlers, lovers, and fencers: the
people of all the world, that dream the least of a day of
reckoning; these were disposed of among the hangmen, Jews,
scribes, and philosophers.&nbsp; There were also a great many
solicitors wondering among themselves, that they should have so
much conscience when they were dead, and none at all
living.&nbsp; In fine, the word was given, Silence.</p>
<p>The throne being erected, and the great day come: a day of
comfort to the good, and of terror to the wicked.&nbsp; The sun
and the stars waited on the footstool; the wind was still; the
water quiet; the earth in suspense and anguish for fear of her
children: and in brief, the whole creation was in anxiety and
disorder.&nbsp; The righteous they were employed in prayers and
thanksgivings; and the ungodly in framing of shifts and evasions,
to extenuate their pains.&nbsp; The guardian angels were at hand,
on the one side to acquit themselves of their duties and
commissions.&nbsp; And on the other side, were the devils hunting
for more matters of aggravation and charge against
offenders.&nbsp; The Ten Commandments had <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>the guard of
a narrow gate, which was so strait, that the most mortified body
could not pass it, without leaving a good part of his skin behind
him.</p>
<p>On one hand, there were in multitudes, disgraces, misfortunes,
plagues, griefs, and troubles; all in a clamour against the
physicians.&nbsp; The plague confessed, indeed, that she had
struck many; but &rsquo;twas the doctor did their business.&nbsp;
Melancholy and disgrace said the like; and misfortunes of all
sorts made open protestation, that they never brought any man to
his grave without the help and advice of a doctor.&nbsp; So that
the gentlemen of the faculty were called to account for those
they had killed.&nbsp; They took their places upon a scaffold,
with pen, ink, and paper about them; and still as the dead were
called, some or other of them answered to the name, and declared
the year and day when such a patient passed through his hand.</p>
<p>They began the inquiry at Adam, who, methought, was severely
handled about an apple.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried Judas
that was by, &ldquo;if that were such a fault, what will become
of me that sold and betrayed my Lord and Master?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Next came the patriarchs, and then the apostles, who took their
places by Saint Peter.&nbsp; It was worth <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the noting,
that at this day there was no distinction between kings and
beggars, before the judgment-seat.&nbsp; Herod and Pilate, so
soon as they put out their heads, found it was like to go hard
with them.&nbsp; &ldquo;My judgment is just,&rdquo; quoth
Pilate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alack!&rdquo; cried Herod, &ldquo;what have
I to trust to?&nbsp; Heaven is no place for me, and in Limbo I
should fall among the innocents I have murdered; so that without
more ado I must e&rsquo;en take up my lodging in hell: the common
receptacle of notorious malefactors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came in immediately upon this a kind of a sour
rough-hewn fellow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look ye,&rdquo; says he,
stretching out his arm, &ldquo;here are my letters.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The company wondered at the humour, and asked the porter what he
was; which he himself overhearing, &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;a master of the noble science of defence;&rdquo; and,
plucking out several sealed parchments, &ldquo;These,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;are the attestations of my exploits.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
which word, all his testimonials fell out of his hand, and a
couple of devils would fain have whipped them up, to have brought
them in evidence against him at his trial; but the fencer was too
nimble for them, and took them up himself.&nbsp; At which time,
an angel offered <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>him his hand to help him in; but he, for fear of an
attack, leaped a step backward, and with great agility, alonging
withal, &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if ye think fit,
I&rsquo;ll give ye a taste of my skill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company
fell a laughing, and this sentence was passed upon him: that
since by his rules of art he had occasioned so many duels and
murders, he should himself go to the devil by a perpendicular
line.&nbsp; He pleaded for himself, that he was no mathematician,
and knew no such line; but while the word was in his mouth a
devil came up to him, gave him a turn and a half, and down he
tumbled.</p>
<p>After him, came the treasurers, and such a cry following them,
for cheating and stealing, that some said the thieves were
coming; others said no; and the company was divided
upon&rsquo;t.&nbsp; They were much troubled at the word, thieves,
and desired the benefit of counsel to plead their cause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And very good reason,&rdquo; said one of the devils,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a discarded apostle that has executed both
offices, let them take him, where&rsquo;s Judas?&rdquo;&nbsp;
When the treasurers heard that, they turned aside, and by chance,
spied in a devil&rsquo;s hand, a huge roll of accusations ready
drawn into a formal charge against them.&nbsp; With that, <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>one of the
boldest among them: &ldquo;Away, away,&rdquo; cried he,
&ldquo;with these informations; we&rsquo;ll rather come to a fine
and compound, though it were for ten or twenty thousand years in
purgatory.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; quoth the devil, a
cunning snap that drew up the charge, &ldquo;if ye are upon those
terms ye are hard put to&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the
treasurers, being brought to a forced put, were e&rsquo;en glad
to make the best of a bad game, and follow the fencer.</p>
<p>These were no sooner gone, but in came an unlucky pastry-man;
they asked him if he would be tried.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
e&rsquo;en as&rsquo;t hits,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; At that word,
the devil that managed the cause against him, pressed his charge,
and laid it home to him, that he had put off cats for hares; and
filled his pies with bones instead of flesh; and not only so, but
that he had sold horse-flesh, dogs, and foxes, for beef and
mutton.&nbsp; Upon the issue, it was proved against him, that
Noah never had so many animals in his ark as this poor fellow had
put in his pies (for we read of no rats and mice there), so that
he e&rsquo;en gave up his cause, and went away to see if his oven
were hot.&nbsp; Next, came the philosophers with their
syllogisms, and it was no ill entertainment to hear them <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>chop logic,
and put all their expostulations, in mood and figure.&nbsp; But
the pleasantest people in the world were the poets, who insisted
upon it, that they were to be tried by Jupiter; and to the charge
of worshiping false gods, their answer was that through them they
worshipped the true one, and were rather mistaken in the name
than in the worship.&nbsp; Virgil had much to say for himself,
for his <i>Sicelides Mus&aelig;</i>; but Orpheus interrupted him,
who being the father of the poets desired to be heard for them
all.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, he?&rdquo; cried one of the devils,
&ldquo;yes; for teaching that boys were better bed-fellows than
wenches; but the women had combed his coxcomb for him, if they
could have catched him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Away with him to hell
once again,&rdquo; then they cried; &ldquo;and let him get out
now if he can.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they all filed off, and Orpheus
was their guide, because he had been there once before.&nbsp; So
soon as the poets were gone, there knocked at the gate a rich
penurious chuff; but &rsquo;twas told him that the Ten
Commandments kept it, and that he had not kept them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;under favour, to
prove that ever I broke any one of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he
went to justify himself from point to point: he had done this and
that; and he <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>had never done that, nor t&rsquo;other; but in the end,
he was delivered over to be rewarded according to his
works.&nbsp; And then came on a company of house-breakers and
robbers, so dexterous, some of them, that they saved themselves
from the very ladder.&nbsp; The scriveners and attorneys
observing that, ah! thought they; if we could but pass for
thieves now!&nbsp; And yet they set a face good enough upon the
business too; which made Judas and Mahomet hope well of
themselves; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;if any of these
fellows come off, there&rsquo;s no fear of us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whereupon they advanced boldly, with a resolution to take their
trial; which set the devils all a laughing.&nbsp; The guardian
angels of the scriveners and attorneys moved that the evangelists
might be of their counsel; which the devils opposed,
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;we shall insist only upon
the matter of fact, and leave them without any possibility of
reply, or excuse.&nbsp; We might indeed content ourselves with
the bare proof of what they are; for &rsquo;tis crime enough that
they are scriveners and attorneys.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that, the
scriveners denied their trade, alleging that they were
secretaries; and the attorneys called themselves
solicitors.&nbsp; All was said, in effect, <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>that the case
would bear; but the best part of their plea was
church-membership.&nbsp; And in fine, after several replications
and rejoinders, they were all sent to Old Nick; save only two or
three, that found mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried one of
the scriveners, &ldquo;this &rsquo;tis to keep lewd
company!&rdquo;&nbsp; The devils called out then, to clear the
bar, and said they should have occasion for the scriveners
themselves, to enter protestations in the quality of public
notaries, against lawless and disorderly people; but the poor
wretches, it seems, could not hear on that ear.&nbsp; To say the
truth, the Christians were much more troublesome than the pagans,
which the devils took exceeding ill; but they had this to say for
themselves, that they were christened when they were children, so
that &rsquo;twas none of their fault, and their parents must
answer for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Judas and Mahomet took such courage,
when they saw two or three of the scriveners and attorneys saved
that they were just upon the point of challenging their clergy;
but they were prevented by the doctor I told ye of, who was set
first to the bar, in company with an apothecary and a barber,
when a certain devil, with a great bundle of evidences in his
hand, informed the court that the greatest part of the <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>dead there
present were sent thither by the doctor then at the bar, in
confederacy with his apothecary and barber, to whom they were to
acknowledge their obligation for that fair assembly.&nbsp; An
angel then interposing for the defendant, recommended the
apothecary for a charitable person and one that physicked the
poor for nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;No matter for that,&rdquo; cried
the devil; &ldquo;for I have him in my books, and am able to
prove that he has killed more people with two little boxes than
the King of Spain has done with two thousand barrels of powder,
in the low-country wars.&nbsp; All his medicines are corrupted,
and his compositions hold a perfect intelligence with the plague:
he has utterly unpeopled a couple of his neighbour villages, in a
matter of three weeks&rsquo; time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The doctor he let
fly upon the &rsquo;pothecary too, and said he would maintain,
against the whole college, that his prescriptions were according
to the dispensatory; and if an apothecary would play the knave,
or the fool, and put in this for that, he could not help
it.&nbsp; So that without any more words the &rsquo;pothecary was
put to the sommersault, and the doctor and barber were brought
off, at the intercession of St. Cosmus and St. Damian.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>After
these, came a dapper lawyer, with a tongue steeped in oil, and a
great master of his words and actions; a most exquisite
flatterer, and no man better skilled in the art of moving the
passions than himself, or more ready at bolting a lucky president
at a dead lift, or at making the best of a bad cause; for he had
all the shifts and starting-holes in the law at his
fingers&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; But all this would not serve, for the
verdict went against him, and he was ordered to pay costs.&nbsp;
In that instant, there was a discovery made of a fellow that hid
himself in a corner, and looked like a spy.&nbsp; They asked him
what he was.&nbsp; He made answer, &ldquo;An
empiric.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said a devil, &ldquo;my
old friend Pont&aelig;us: Alas! alas! thou hadst ten thousand
times better be in Covent Garden now, or at Charing Cross; for
upon my word thou&rsquo;t have nothing to do here, unless,
perhaps, for an ointment for a burn or so;&rdquo; and so
Pont&aelig;us went his way.&nbsp; The next that appeared were a
company of vintners, who were accused for adulterating and
mingling water with their wines.&nbsp; Their plea was that in
compensation they had furnished the hospitals with communion-wine
that was right, upon free cost; but this excuse signified as
little as that of the <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>tailors there present, who suggested
that they had clothed so many friars, gratis; and so they were
dispatched away together.&nbsp; After these, followed a number of
bankers, that had turned bankrupt to cozen their creditors; who
finding there several of their old correspondents, that they had
reduced to a morsel of bread, began to treat of composition; but
one of the devils presently cried out, &ldquo;All the rest have
had enough to do to answer for themselves; but these people are
to reckon for other men&rsquo;s scores as well as their
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; And hereupon, they were forthwith sent away to
Pluto with letters of exchange; but, as it happened at that time,
the devil was out of cash.</p>
<p>After this, entered a Spanish cavalier, as upright as Justice
itself.&nbsp; He was a matter of a quarter of an hour in his legs
and reverences to the company.&nbsp; We could see no head he had,
for his prodigious starched ruff that stood staring up like a
turkey-cock&rsquo;s tail, and covered it.&nbsp; In fine, it was
so fantastic a figure that the porter was gaping at it a good
while, and asked if it were a man, or no?&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a
man,&rdquo; quoth the Spaniard, &ldquo;upon the honour of a
cavalier, and his name is Don Pedro Rhodomontadoso,&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; He was so long <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>a telling his name and titles that
one of the devils burst out a laughing in the middle of his
pedigree, and demanded What he would be at.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; quoth he, which they taking in the worse
sense, for pride, sent him away immediately to Lucifer.&nbsp; He
was a little severe upon his guides, for disordering his
mustachios, but they helped him presently to a pair of
beard-irons, and all was well again.</p>
<p>In the next place, came a fellow, weeping and wailing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, my masters,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;my cause is never
the worse for my crying, for if I would stand upon my merits, I
could tell ye that I have kept as good company, and had as much
to do with the saints as another body.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What
have we here,&rdquo; cried one, &ldquo;Diocletian, or
Nero?&rdquo;&nbsp; For they had enough to do with the saints,
though &rsquo;twere but to persecute them.&nbsp; But upon the
upshot, what was this poor creature but a small officer, that
swept the church and dusted the images and pictures.&nbsp; His
charge was for stealing the oil out of the lamps and leaving all
in the dark, pretending that the owls and jackdaws had drunk it
up.&nbsp; He had a trick too of clothing himself out of the
church habits, which he got new-dyed; and of cramming his
porridge with consecrated <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>bread, that he stole every
Sunday.&nbsp; What he said for himself, I know not; but he had
his mittimus, and took the left-hand way at parting.</p>
<p>With that, a voice was heard, &ldquo;Make way there, clear the
passage;&rdquo; and this was for a bevy of handsome, buxom Bona
Roba&rsquo;s, in their caps and feathers that came dancing,
laughing, and singing of ballads and lampoons, and as merry as
the day was long.&nbsp; But they quickly changed their note, for
so soon as ever they saw the hideous looks of the devils, they
fell into violent fits of the mother; beating their breasts, and
tearing their hair, with all the horror and fury
imaginable.&nbsp; There was an angel offered in their favour that
they had been great frequenters of Our Lady&rsquo;s chapel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried a devil, &ldquo;less of her chapel,
and more of her virtue, would have done well.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was a notable whipster, among the rest, that confessed the devil
had reason.&nbsp; And then her trial came on, for making a cloak
of a sacrament, and only marrying, that she might play the whore
with privilege, and never want a father for her bastards.&nbsp;
It was her fortune alone to be condemned; and going along,
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;if I had thought
&rsquo;twould have come to this, <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>I should ne&rsquo;er have troubled
myself with so many masses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, after long waiting, came Judas and Mahomet upon the
stage, and to them Jack of Leyden.&nbsp; Up comes an officer and
asked which of the three was Judas.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo;
quoth Jack of Leyden.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, but I am Judas,&rdquo;
cried Mahomet.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a couple of lying
rascals,&rdquo; says Judas himself, &ldquo;for I am the man: only
the rogues make use of my name to save their credit.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis true I sold my Master once, and the world has ever
since been the better for&rsquo;t; but these villains sell Him
and themselves too every hour of the day, and there follows
nothing but misery and confusion.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they were all
three packed away to their disciples.</p>
<p>The angel that kept the book found that the serjeants and
remembrancers were to come on next; whereupon they were called,
and appeared; but the court was not much troubled with them, for
they confessed guilty at first word, and so were tied up without
any more ado.</p>
<p>The next that appeared was an astrologer, loaden with
almanacks, globes, astrolabes, etc., making proclamation as loud
as he could bawl that there must needs be a gross mistake in the
reckoning, <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>for Saturn had not finished his course, and the world
could not be yet at an end.&nbsp; One of the devils that saw how
he came provided, and looked upon him as his own already:
&ldquo;A provident slave,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;I warrant him,
to bring his firing along with him.&nbsp; But this I must needs
tell ye,&rdquo; says he to the mathematician, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a
strange thing, ye should create so many heavens in your life, and
go to the devil for want of one after your death.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay, for going,&rdquo; cried the astrologer, &ldquo;ye
shall excuse me; but if you&rsquo;ll carry me, well and
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; And immediately order was given to carry him
away and pay the porter.</p>
<p>Hereupon, methought, the court rose, the throne vanished; the
shadows and darkness withdrew; the air sweetened; the earth was
covered with flowers; the heavens clear: and then I waked, not a
little satisfied to find that after all this, I was still in my
bed, and among the living.&nbsp; The use I made of my dream was
this: I betook myself presently to my prayers, with a firm
resolution of changing my life, and putting my soul into such a
frame of piety and obedience, that I might attend the coming of
the great day with peace and comfort.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">THE END OF THE THIRD VISION</p>
<h2><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>THE
FOURTH VISION OF LOVING FOOLS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> four o&rsquo;clock, in a cold
frosty morning, when it was much better being in a warm bed, with
a good bedfellow, than upon a bier in the churchyard; as I lay
advising with my pillow, tumbling and tossing a thousand
love-toys in my head, I passed from one fancy to another, till at
last I fell into a slumber; and there appeared the genius of
disabuse, laying before me all the follies, and vanities of love,
and supporting her opinions with great authorities and
reasons.&nbsp; I was carried then (methought I knew not how) into
a fair meadow: a meadow, pleasant and agreeable infinitely beyond
the very fictions of your half-witted poets, with all their
far-fetched gilding, and enamellings (for a paper of verses is
worth nothing with them, unless they force nature for&rsquo;t, <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>and rifle
both the Indies).&nbsp; This delicious field was watered with two
rivulets, the one bitter, the other sweet; and yet they mingled
their streams with a pretty kind of murmur, equal perhaps to the
best music in the world.&nbsp; The use of these waters was (as I
observed) to temper the darts of love; for while I was upon the
prospect of the place, I saw several of Cupid&rsquo;s little
officers, and subjects, dipping of arrows there, for their
entertainment and ease.&nbsp; Upon this, I fancied myself in one
of the gardens of Cyprus, and that I saw the very hive, where the
bee lived that stung my young master, and occasioned that
excellent ode which Anacreon has written upon the subject.&nbsp;
The next thing I cast my eye upon was a palace in the midst of
the meadow; a rare piece, as well for the structure as
design.&nbsp; The porches were of the Doric order, excellently
wrought; and the pedestals, bases, columns, cornices, capitals,
architraves, friezes (and in short the whole front of the fabric)
was beautified with imaginary trophies, and triumphs of love, in
half relief, which as they were intermixed with other fantastic
works and conceits, carried the face of several little histories,
and gave a great ornament to the building.&nbsp; Over the <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>porch,
there was in golden letters, upon black marble, this
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is called fools&rsquo; paradise,<br />
From the loving fools that dwell in&rsquo;t,<br />
Where the great fools rule the less,<br />
The rest obey, and all do well in&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The finishing and materials were pleasant to admiration.&nbsp;
The portal spacious, the doors always open, and the house free to
all comers, which were very many; the porter&rsquo;s place was
supplied by a woman; exquisitely handsome, both for face and
person; tall, delicately shaped, and set off with great
advantages of dress, and jewels.&nbsp; She was made up, in fine,
of charms, and her name (as I understood) was Beauty.&nbsp; She
would let any man in to see the house for a look; and that was
all I paid for my passage.&nbsp; In the first court, I found a
many of both sexes, but so altered in habit and countenance, that
they could scarce know one another.&nbsp; They were sad, pensive;
and their complexions tinted with a yellow paleness (which Ovid
calls Cupid&rsquo;s livery).&nbsp; There was no talk of being
true to friends; loyal to superiors; and dutiful to parents: but
kindred did the office of procurers; and procurers were called
cousins.&nbsp; Wives <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>loved their husbands&rsquo; she
friends, and husbands did as much for them, in loving their
gallants.</p>
<p>While I was upon the contemplation of these encounters of
affection, there appeared a strange extravagant figure, but in
the likeness of a human creature.&nbsp; It was neither perfectly
man nor perfectly woman, but had indeed a resemblance of
both.&nbsp; This person I perceived was ever busy, up and down,
going and coming; beset all over with eyes and ears, and had one
of the craftiest distrustful looks (methought) that ever I
saw.&nbsp; And withal, (as I observed) no small authority in the
place, which made me inquire after this creature&rsquo;s name,
and office.&nbsp; &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; quoth she, for now it
proved to be a woman, &ldquo;is Jealousy, and methinks, you and I
should be better acquainted, for how came you here else?&nbsp;
However, for your satisfaction, you are to understand that the
greater part of the distempered people you see here are of my
bringing; and yet I am not their physician, but their tormentor;
and serve only to aggravate and embitter their misfortunes.&nbsp;
If you would know anything further of the house, never ask me,
for &rsquo;tis forty to one I shall tell you a lie; I have not
told you half the truth even of myself; <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>and to deal
plainly with you, I am made up of inventions, artifice, and
imposture: but the good old man that walks there, is the Major
Domo, and will tell you all, if you will but bear with his slow
way of discourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I went to the good man, whom I knew presently to be
Time, and desired him to let me look into the several quarters
and lodgings of the house, for there were some fools of my
acquaintance there I&rsquo;d fain visit; he told me that he was
at present so busy about making of caudles, cock-broths, and
jellies for his patients, that he could not stir; but yet he
directed me where I might find all those I inquired for, and gave
me the freedom of the house to walk at pleasure.</p>
<p>I passed out of the first court, into the maids&rsquo;
quarter, which was the very strongest part of the whole building;
and so&rsquo;t had need; for divers of the young wenches were so
extravagant and furious, that no other place would have held
them.&nbsp; (The wives and widows were in another room
apart.)&nbsp; Here ye should have one, sobbing and raging with
jealousy of a rival.&nbsp; There another, stark mad for a
husband, and inwardly bleeding because she durst not discover
it.&nbsp; A third was <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>writing of letters all riddle and
mystery, mending and marring, till at last the paper had more
blots than whole words in it.&nbsp; Some were practising in the
glass the gracious smile, the roll of the eye, the velvet lip,
etc.&nbsp; Others again were in a diet of oatmeal, clay, chalk,
coal, hard wax, and the like.&nbsp; Some were conditioning with
their servants for a ball, or a serenade, that the whole town
might ring of the address.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; they
cried, &ldquo;you can go to the park with this lady, and to a
play with that lady, and to Banstead with t&rsquo;other lady, and
spend whole nights at beste or ombre with my Lady Pen-Tweezel;
but by my troth, I think you are ashamed to be seen in my
company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some I saw upon the very point of sealing
and delivering.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am thine,&rdquo; cries one,
&ldquo;and thine alone, or let all the devils in hell, etc.&nbsp;
But be sure you be constant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I be
not,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;let my soul,&rdquo; etc., and the
silly jade believes him.&nbsp; In one corner ye should have them
praying for husbands, that they might the better love at random;
in another, nothing would please them but to be married
men&rsquo;s wives, and this disease was looked upon as a little
desperate.&nbsp; Some again stood ready furnished with love
letters <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>and tickets to be cast out at the window, or thrust
under the door, and these were looked upon not only as fools but
beasts.</p>
<p>I had seen as much already as I desired, for I had learned of
old that he that keeps such company seldom comes off without a
scratched face; but if he misses a mistress, he gets a wife, and
stands condemned to a repentance during life, without redemption,
unless one of the two dies.&nbsp; For women in the case are worse
than pirates; a galley-slave may compound for his freedom, but
there&rsquo;s no thought of ransom in case of wedlock.&nbsp; I
had a good mind to a little chat with some of them, but (thought
I) they&rsquo;ll fancy I&rsquo;m in love with them.&nbsp; And so
I e&rsquo;en marched off into the married quarter, where there
was such ranting, damning, and tearing, as if hell had been broke
loose.&nbsp; And what was all this? but a number of women that
had been locked up and shackled by their husbands, to keep them
in obedience, and had now broken their prisons, and their chains,
and were grown ten times madder than before.&nbsp; Some I saw
caressing and coaxing their husbands, in the very moment they
designed to betray them.&nbsp; Others were picking their
husbands&rsquo; pockets to <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>pay now and then for a
by-blow.&nbsp; Some again were upon a religious point, and all
upon the humour (forsooth) of pilgrimages and lectures; when
alas! they had no other business with the altars or churches than
a sacrifice to Venus, or a love meeting.&nbsp; Divers there were
that went to the bath; but bathing was the least part of their
errand.&nbsp; Others to confession, that mistook their martyr for
their confessor: some to be revenged of jealous husbands were
resolving to do the thing they feared, and pay them in their own
coin.&nbsp; Others were for making sure aforehand by way of
advance; for that&rsquo;s the revenge, they say, that&rsquo;s as
sweet as muscadine and eggs.&nbsp; One was melancholy for a
delay; another for a defeat; a third is preparing to make her
market at a play.&nbsp; There was one among the rest was never
out of her coach; and asking her the reason, she told me, she
loved to be jolted.&nbsp; In this crowd of women, you must know
that there were no wives of ambassadors, soldiers, or merchants
that were abroad upon commission; for such were considered in
effect as single women, and not allowed as members of this
commonwealth.</p>
<p>The next quarter was that of the grave <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>and wise,
the right reverend widows, women in appearance of marvellous
severity and reserve, and yet every one of them had her weak
side, and ye might read her folly and distemper through her
disguise.&nbsp; One of them I saw crying with one eye for the
loss of one husband, and laughing with t&rsquo;other upon him
that was to come next.&nbsp; Another, with the Ephesian matron,
was solacing herself with her gallant before her husband was
thorough cold in the mouth, considering, that he that died half
an hour ago is as dead as William the Conqueror.&nbsp; There were
several others passing to and again, quite out of their mourning,
that looked so demurely (I warrant ye) as if butter would not
have melted in their mouths, and yet apostate widows (as I was
told) and there they were kept as strictly, as if they had been
in the Spanish Inquisition.&nbsp; Some were laying wagers whose
mourning was most <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, and best made, or
whose peak or veil became her best, and setting themselves off
with a thousand tricks of ornament and dress.&nbsp; The widows I
observed that were marching off, with the mark out of their
mouths, were hugely concerned to be thought young, and still
talking of masks, balls, fiddles, treats; chanting and <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>jigging to
every tune they heard, and all upon the hoity-toity like mad
wenches of fifteen.&nbsp; The younger, on the other side, made
use of their time and took pleasure while &rsquo;twas to be
had.&nbsp; There were too of the religious strain; a people much
at their beads, and in private; and these were there in the
quality of love heretics, or platonics, and under the penance of
perpetual abstinence from the flesh they loved best (which is the
most mortifying Lent of all other).&nbsp; Some, that had skill in
perspective, were before the glass with their boxes of patch and
paint about them; shadowing, drawing out, refreshing, and in
short, covering and palliating, all the imperfections of feature
and complexion, every one after her own humour.&nbsp; Now these
women were absolutely insufferable, for they were most of them
old and headstrong, having got the better of their husbands, so
that they would be taking upon them to domineer here, as they had
done at home; and indeed, they found the master of the college
enough to do.</p>
<p>When I had tired myself with this variety of folly and
madness, I went to the devotees, where I found a great many women
and girls that had cloistered up themselves from the conversation
of the <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>world; and yet were not a jot soberer than their
fellows.&nbsp; These one would have thought might have been
easily cured, but many of them were in for their lives, in
despite of either counsel or physic.&nbsp; The room where they
were was barricaded with strong bars of iron; and yet when the
toy took them, they&rsquo;d make now and then a sally; for when
the fit was upon them, they&rsquo;d own no superior but love,
come what would on&rsquo;t in the event.&nbsp; The greater part
of these good people were writing of tickets and dispatches,
which had still the sign of the cross at the top, and Satan at
the bottom, concluding with this, or some such postscript: I
commend this paper to your discretion.&nbsp; The fools of this
province would be twattling night and day; and if it happened
that any one of them had talked herself a-weary (which was very
rare), she would presently take upon her very gravely to admonish
the rest, and read a lecture of silence to the company.&nbsp;
There were some that for want of better entertainment fell in
love with one another; but these were looked upon as a sort of
fops and ninnies, and therefore the more favourably used; but
they&rsquo;d have been of another mind, if they had known the
cause of their distemper.</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>The
root of all these several extravagances was idleness, which
(according to Petrarch&rsquo;s observation) never fails to make
way for wantonness.&nbsp; There was one among the rest that had
more letters of exchange upon the credit of her insatiable
desires than a whole regiment of bankers.&nbsp; Some of them were
sick of their old visitor, and called for a freshman.&nbsp;
Others, by intervals, I perceived, had their wits about them, and
contented themselves discreetly with the physician of the
house.&nbsp; In short, it e&rsquo;en pitied my heart to see so
many poor people in so sad a condition and without any hope of
relief, as I gathered from him that had them in care; for they
were still puddering and royling their bodies; and if they got a
little ease for the present, they&rsquo;d be down again as soon
as they had taken their medicine.</p>
<p>From thence I went to the single women (such as made
profession never to marry) which were the least outrageous and
discomposed of all; for they had a thousand ways to lay the devil
as well as to raise him.&nbsp; Some of them lived like common
highwaymen, by robbing Peter to pay Paul; and stripping honest
men to clothe rascals, which is (under favour) but <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>a lewd kind
of charity.&nbsp; Others there were, that were absolutely out of
their seven senses, and as mad as March hares for this wit and
t&rsquo;other poet, that never failed to pay them again in rhymes
and madrigals, with ruby lips, pearly teeth, so that to read
their verses, a man would swear the whole woman to be directly
petrified.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of sapphire fair, or crystal clear,<br />
Is the forehead of my dear, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I saw one in consultation with a cunning man to know her
fortune; another, dealing with a conjurer for a philter, or drink
to make her beloved.&nbsp; A third was daubing and patching up an
old ruined face, to make it fresh and young again; but she might
as well have been washing of a blackamoor to make him
white.&nbsp; In fine, a world there were, that with their
borrowed hair, teeth, eyes, eyebrows, looked like fine folks at a
distance, but would have been left as ridiculous as
&AElig;sop&rsquo;s crow, if every bird had fetched away his own
feather.&nbsp; &rsquo;Deliver me (thought I, smiling and shaking
my head) if this be woman.</p>
<p>And so I stepped into the men&rsquo;s quarter, which was but
next door, and only a thick <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>wall between.&nbsp; Their great
misery was that they were deaf to good advice, obstinately hating
and despising both physic and physician; for if they would have
either quitted or changed, they might have been cured.&nbsp; But
they chose rather to die, and though they saw their error, would
not mend it.&nbsp; Which minded me of the old rhyme:</p>
<blockquote><p>Where love&rsquo;s in the case,<br />
The doctor&rsquo;s an ass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These fools-male were all in the same chamber; and one might
perfectly read their humour and distemper in their looks and
gestures.&nbsp; Oh! how many a gay lad did I see there in his
point band and embroidered vest that had not a whole shirt to his
back!&nbsp; How many huffs and highboys that had nothing else in
their mouths but the lives and fortunes they&rsquo;d spend in
their sweet ladies&rsquo; service! that would yet have run five
miles on your errand, to have been treated but at a threepenny
ordinary?&nbsp; How many a poor devil that wanted bread, and was
yet troubled with the rebellion of the flesh!&nbsp; Some there
were that spent much time in setting their perukes, ordering the
mustache, and <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>dressing up the very face of Lucifer himself for a
beauty: the woman&rsquo;s privilege, and in truth an
encroachment, to their prejudice.&nbsp; There were others that
made it their glory to pass for Hectors, sons of Priam, brothers
of the blade; and talked of nothing but attacks, combats,
reverses, stramazons, stoccados; not considering that a naked
weapon is present death to a timorous woman.&nbsp; Some were
taking the round of their ladies&rsquo; lodgings, at midnight,
and went to bed again as wise as they rose.&nbsp; Others fell in
love by contagion and merely conversing with the infected.&nbsp;
Some again went post from church to chapel, every holy day, to
hunt for a mistress; and so turned a day of rest into a day of
labour.&nbsp; Ye might see others skipping continually from house
to house, like the knight upon a chess-board, without ever
catching the (queen or) dame.&nbsp; Some, like crafty beggars,
made their case worse than &rsquo;twas: and others, though
&rsquo;twere ne&rsquo;er so bad, durst not so much as open their
mouths.&nbsp; Really it grieved me for the poor mutes, and I
wished with all my heart their mistresses had been witches, that
they might have known their meaning by their mumping; but they
were lost to all counsel, so that there was no advising <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>them.&nbsp;
There was another sort of elevated, and conceited lovers; and
these forsooth were not to be satisfied without the seven liberal
sciences, and the four cardinal virtues, in the shape of a woman;
and their case was desperate.&nbsp; The next I observed were a
generation of modest fools, that passed under the notion of
people diffident of themselves.&nbsp; They were generally men of
good understanding, but for the most part younger brothers, of
low fortunes, and such as for want of wherewithal to go to the
price of higher amours, were fain to take up with ordinary stuff,
that brought them nothing in the end, but beggary and
repentance.&nbsp; The husbands, I perceived, were horribly
furious, although in manacles and shackles.&nbsp; Some of them
left their own wives, and fell upon their
neighbours&rsquo;.&nbsp; Others, to keep the good women in awe
and obedience, would be taking upon them, and playing the
tyrants, but upon the upshot they found their mistake, and that
though they came on as fierce as lions, they went off as tame as
muttons.&nbsp; Some were making friendships with their
wives&rsquo; she-cousins, and agreeing upon a cross-gossiping
whoever should have the first child.</p>
<p>The widowers, that had bit of the bridle, <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>passed from
place to place, where they stayed more or less, according to
their entertainment, and so were in effect, as good as married;
for as long, or as little a while as themselves pleased.&nbsp;
These lived single, and spent their time in visiting, first one
friend, then another.&nbsp; Here they fell in love; there they
kindled a jealousy, which they contracted themselves in one
place, and cured it in another.&nbsp; But the miracle was, that
they all knew, and confessed themselves a company of mad fools,
and yet continued so.&nbsp; Those that had skill in music, and
could either sing or fiddle, made use of their gifts, to put the
silly wenches that were but half moped before, directly out of
their wits.&nbsp; They that were poetical were perpetually
hammering upon the subjects of cruelty and disappointment.&nbsp;
One tells his good fortune to another, that requites him with the
story of his bad.&nbsp; They that had set their hearts upon girls
were beating the streets all day, to find what avenues to a
lady&rsquo;s lodgings at night.&nbsp; Some were tampering and
caressing the chamber-maid, as the ready way to the
mistress.&nbsp; Others chose rather to put it to the push, and
attempt the lady herself.&nbsp; Some were examining their pockets
and taking a view of their furniture, which <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>consisted
much in love-letters, delicately sealed up with perfumed wax,
upon raw silk; and a thousand pretty devices within; all wrapt up
in riddle, and cipher.&nbsp; Abundance of hair bracelets,
lockets, pomanders, knots of riband, and the like.&nbsp; There
were others, that were called the husband&rsquo;s friends, who
were ready upon all occasions to do this, and to do that kindness
for the husband.&nbsp; Their purse, credit, coach and horses,
were all at his service; and in the meantime, who but they to
gallant the wife?&nbsp; To the park, the gardens, a treat, or a
comedy, where forty to one, by the greatest good luck in the
world, they stumble upon an aunt, an old housekeeper of the
family, or some such reverend goer-between that&rsquo;s a
well-willer to the mathematics; she takes the hint, performs the
good office, and the work is done.</p>
<p>Now there were two sorts of fools for the widows: the one was
beloved, and the other not.&nbsp; The latter were content to be a
kind of voluntary slaves, for the compassing their ends; but the
other were the happier, for they were ever at perfect liberty to
do their pleasure, unless some friend or child of the house
perchance came in, in the mischievous nick, and <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>then in
case of a little colour more than ordinary, or a tumbled
handkercher: &rsquo;twas but changing the scene, and struggling
for a paper of verses, or some such business to keep all in
countenance.&nbsp; Some made their assaults both with love and
money, and they seldom failed, for they came doubly armed; and
your Spanish pistols are a sort of battery hardly to be
resisted.</p>
<p>I came now to reflect upon what I had seen, and as I was
walking (in that meditation) toward another lodging, I found
myself (ere I was aware) in the first court again; where I
entered, and in it I observed new wonders: I saw that the number
of the mad fools increased every moment; although time (I
perceived) did all that was possible to recover them.&nbsp; There
was Jealousy tormenting even those that were most confident of
the faith of what they loved.&nbsp; There was Memory rubbing of
old sores.&nbsp; There was Understanding, locked up in a dark
cellar; and Reason with both her eyes out.&nbsp; I made a little
pause, the better to observe these varieties and disguises.&nbsp;
And when I had looked myself a-weary, I turned about and spied a
door; but so narrow that it was hardly passable; and yet strait
as it was, divers there were that ingratitude and infidelity <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>had set at
liberty, and made a shift to get through.&nbsp; Upon which
opportunity of returning, I made what haste I could to be one of
the first at the door, and in that instant, my man drew the
curtain of my bed, and told me the morning was far spent.&nbsp;
Whereupon I waked, and recollecting myself, found all was but a
dream.&nbsp; The very fancy however of having spent so much time
in the company of fools and madmen, gave me some disorder, but
with this comfort, that both sleeping and waking, I had
experimented passionate love to be nothing else than a mere
frenzy and folly.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">THE END OF THE FOURTH VISION</p>
<h2><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>THE
FIFTH VISION OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is utterly impossible for
anything in this world to fix our appetites and desires; but they
are still flitting, and restless like pilgrims; delighted and
nourished with variety: which shows how much we are mistaken in
the value and quality of the things we covet.&nbsp; And hence it
is, that what we pursue with the greatest delight and passion
imaginable, yields us nothing but satiety and repentance in the
possession; yet such is the power of these appetites of ours that
when they call and command, we follow and obey; though we find in
the end that what we took for a beauty, upon the chase proves but
a carcass in the quarry; and we are sick on&rsquo;t as soon as we
have it.&nbsp; Now the world, that knows our palate and
inclination, never fails to feed the humour, and to flatter and
entertain us with all sorts of <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>change and novelty, as the most
certain method of gaining upon our affections.</p>
<p>One would have thought that these considerations might have
put sober thoughts and resolutions in my head, but it was my fate
to be taken off, in the very middle of my morality and
speculations, and carried away from myself by vanity and weakness
into the wide world, where I was for a certain time, not much
unsatisfied with my condition.&nbsp; As I passed from one place
to another, several that saw me (I perceived) did but make sport
with me: for the further I went, the more I was at a loss in that
labyrinth of delusions.&nbsp; One while I was in with the
sword-men and bravoes; up to the ears in challenges, and
quarrels; and never without an arm in a scarf, or a broken
head.&nbsp; Another fit; I was never well, but at the Fleece
Tavern, or Bear at bridge-foot, stuffing my guts with food and
tipple, till the hoops were ready to burst.&nbsp; Beside twenty
other entertainments that I found, every jot as extravagant as
these, which to my great trouble and admiration left me not so
much as one moment of repose.</p>
<p>As I was in one of my unquiet and pensive moods, somebody
called after me, and plucked me by the cloak, which <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>proved to
be a person of a venerable age; his clothes miserably poor and
tattered; and his face, just as if he had been trampled upon in
the streets, which did not yet hinder but that he had still the
air and appearance of one that deserved much honour and
respect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good father,&rdquo; said I to him,
&ldquo;why should you envy me my enjoyments?&nbsp; Pray&rsquo;e
let me alone, and do not trouble yourself with me or my
doings.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re past the pleasure of life yourself,
and can&rsquo;t endure to see other people merry, that have the
world before them.&nbsp; Consider of it; you are now upon the
point of leaving the world, and I am but newly come into&rsquo;t,
but &rsquo;tis the trick of all old men to be carping at the
actions of their juniors.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said
the old man, smiling, &ldquo;I shall neither hinder nor envy thy
delights, but in pure pity I would fain reclaim thee.&nbsp; Dost
thou know the price of a day an hour or a minute?&nbsp; Didst
ever examine the value of time?&nbsp; If thou hadst, thou wouldst
employ it better; and not cast away so many blessed opportunities
upon trifles; and so easily, and insensibly, part with so
inestimable a treasure.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s become of thy past
hours? have they made thee a promise to come back again at a
call, <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>when thou hast need of them?&nbsp; Or, canst thou show
me which way they went?&nbsp; No, no; they are gone without
recovery; and in their flight, methinks, Time seems to turn his
head, and laugh over his shoulder in derision of those that made
no better use of him, when they had him.&nbsp; Dost thou not know
that all the minutes of our life are but as so many links of a
chain that has death at the end on&rsquo;t? and every moment
brings thee nearer thy expected end, which perchance, while the
word is speaking, may be at thy very door; and doubtless at thy
rate of living, it will be upon thee before thou art aware.&nbsp;
How stupid is he that dies while he lives, for fear of
dying!&nbsp; How wicked is he that lives, as if he should never
die; and only fears death when he comes to feel it! which is too
late for comfort, either to body or soul: and he is certainly
none of the wisest that spends all his days in lewdness and
debauchery, without considering that of his whole life any minute
might have been his last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good father,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am beholding to
you for your excellent discourses, for they have delivered me out
of the power of a thousand frivolous and vain affections, that
had taken possession of me.&nbsp; But who <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>are you, I
pray&rsquo;ee?&nbsp; And what is your business here?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;My poverty and these rags,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;are
enough to tell ye that I am an honest man, a friend to truth, and
one that will not be mealy-mouthed, when he may speak it to
purpose.&nbsp; Some call me the plain-dealer; others, the
undeceiver-general.&nbsp; You see me all in tatters, wounds,
scars, bruises.&nbsp; And what is all this but the requital the
world gives me for my good counsel and kind visits?&nbsp; And yet
after all this endeavour to get shut of me they call themselves
my friends, though they curse me to the pit of hell, as soon as
ever I come near them; and had rather be hanged than spend one
quarter of an hour in my company.&nbsp; If thou hast a mind to
see the world I talk of, come along with me, and I&rsquo;ll carry
thee into a place where thou shalt have a full prospect of it,
and without any inconvenience see all that&rsquo;s in&rsquo;t, or
in the people that dwell in&rsquo;t, and look it through and
through.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of this
place?&rdquo; quoth I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is called,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the Hypocrites&rsquo; Walk; and it crosses the world from
one Pole to th&rsquo; other.&nbsp; It is large, and populous; for
I believe there&rsquo;s not any man alive but has either a house
or a chamber in&rsquo;t.&nbsp; <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Some live in&rsquo;t for altogether;
others take it only in passage: for there are hypocrites of
several sorts; but all mortals have, more or less, a tang of the
leaven.&nbsp; That fellow there in the corner came but
t&rsquo;other day from the plow tail, and would now fain be a
gentleman.&nbsp; But had not he better pay his debts, and walk
alone, than break his promises to keep a lackey?&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s another rascal that would fain be a lord, and would
venture a voyage to Venice for the title, but that he&rsquo;s
better at building castles in the air than upon the water.&nbsp;
In the meantime he puts on a nobleman&rsquo;s face and garb; he
swears and drinks like a lord, and keeps his hounds and whores,
which &rsquo;tis feared in the end will devour their
master.&nbsp; Mark now that piece of gravity and form; he walks,
ye see, as if he moved by clock-work; his words are few and low;
he makes all his answers by a shrug or a nod.&nbsp; This is the
hypocrite of a Minister of State, who with all his counterfeit of
wisdom is one of the veriest noddies in nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Face about now, and mind those decrepit sots there that
can scarce lift a leg over a threshold, and yet they must be
dyeing their hair, colouring their beards, and playing the young
fools again, with a <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>thousand hobby-horse tricks and
antique dresses.&nbsp; On the other side, ye have a company of
silly boys taking upon them to govern the world, under a visor of
wisdom and experience.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What lord is
that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in the rich clothes there, and the
fine laces?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That lord,&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;is a tailor, in his holiday clothes; and if he were now
upon his shop-board, his own scissors and needles would hardly
know him: and you must understand that hypocrisy is so epidemical
a disease that it has laid hold of the trades themselves as well
as the masters.&nbsp; The cobbler must be saluted Mr.
Translator.&nbsp; The groom names himself gentleman of the horse;
the fellow that carries guts to the bears, writes, one of His
Majesty&rsquo;s officers.&nbsp; The hangman calls himself a
minister of justice.&nbsp; The mountebank, an able man.&nbsp; A
common whore passes for a courtesan.&nbsp; The bawd acts the
Puritan.&nbsp; Gaming ordinaries are called academies; and
bawdy-houses, places of entertainment.&nbsp; The page styles
himself the child of honour; and the foot-boy calls himself my
lady&rsquo;s page.&nbsp; And every pick-thank names himself a
courtier.&nbsp; The cuckold-maker passes for a fine gentleman;
and the cuckold himself, for the best-natured husband in the
world: and a very <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>ass commences master-doctor.&nbsp; Hocus-pocus tricks
are called sleight-of-hand; lust, friendship; usury, thrift;
cheating is but gallantry; lying wears the name of invention;
malice goes for quickness of apprehension; cowardice, meekness of
nature; and rashness carries the countenance of valour.&nbsp; In
fine, this is all but hypocrisy, and knavery in a disguise, for
nothing is called by the right name.&nbsp; Now there are beside
these, certain general appellations taken up, which by long usage
are almost grown into prescription.&nbsp; Every little whore
takes upon her to be a great lady; every gown-man, to be a
councillor; every huff to be a <i>soldat</i>; every gay thing to
be a cavalier; every parish-clerk to be a doctor; and every
writing-clerk in the office must be called Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that the whole world, take it where you will, is but
a mere juggle; and you will find that wrath, gluttony, pride,
avarice, luxury, murder, and a thousand other heinous sins, have
all of them hypocrisy for their source, and thither they&rsquo;ll
return again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be well,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;if you could prove what you say; but I can hardly see
how so great a diversity of waters should proceed from one and
the same fountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>not
wonder,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;at your distrust, for you are
mistaken in very good company; to fancy a contrariety in many
things, which are, in effect, so much alike.&nbsp; It is agreed
upon, both by philosophers and divines, that all sins are evil;
and you must allow, that the will embraces or pursues no evil but
under the resemblance of good; nor does the sin lie in the
representation, or knowledge of what is evil, but in the consent
to it.&nbsp; Which consent itself is sinful, although without any
subsequent act: it&rsquo;s true, the execution serves afterward
for an aggravation, and ought to be considered under many
differences and distinctions.&nbsp; But in fine, evident it is
that the will entertains no ill, but under the shape of some
good.&nbsp; What do ye think now of the hypocrite that cuts your
throat in his arms, and murders you, under pretence of
kindness?&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the hope of an hypocrite?&rsquo;
says Job.&nbsp; He neither has nor can have any: for he is wicked
as he is an hypocrite; and even his best actions are worth
nothing, because they are not what they seem to be.&nbsp; So that
of all sinners he has the most to answer for.&nbsp; Other
offenders sin only against God.&nbsp; But the hypocrite sins with
Him, as well as against Him, making <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>use of His holy Name as a cloak and
countenance for his wickedness.&nbsp; For which reason, our
blessed Saviour, after many affirmative precepts delivered to His
disciples for their instruction, gave only this negative:
&lsquo;Be not sad as the hypocrites,&rsquo; which lays them open
in few words; and He might as well have said &lsquo;Be not
hypocrites, and ye shall not be wicked.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were now come to the place the old man told me of, where I
found all according to my expectation, and took the higher
ground, that I might have the better prospect of what
passed.&nbsp; The first remarkable thing I saw was a long funeral
train of kindred and guests, following the corpse of a deceased
lady, in company with the disconsolate widower, who marched with
his chin upon his breast, a sad and a heavy pace, muffled up in a
mourning hood, enough to have stifled him, with at least ten
yards of cloth upon his body, and no less in his train.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alack, alack!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that ever I should
live to see so dismal a spectacle!&nbsp; Oh blessed woman!&nbsp;
How did this husband love thee in thy lifetime, that follows thee
with this infinite faith and affection, even to thy grave!&nbsp;
And happy the husband, doubtless, in a wife that deserved this
kindness! and <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>in so many tender friends and relations, to take part
with him in his sorrows.&nbsp; My good father, let me entreat you
to observe this doleful encounter.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that
(shaking his head and smiling) &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;thou shalt by and by perceive that all is nothing in the
world but vanity, imposture, and constraint; and I will shew thee
the difference between things themselves, and their
appearances.&nbsp; To see this abundance of torches, with the
magnificence of the ceremony and attendance, one would think
there should be some mighty matter in the business; but let me
assure thee that all this pudder comes to no more than much ado
about nothing.&nbsp; The woman was nothing (effectually) even
while she lived: the body now in the coffin is somewhat a less
nothing: and the funeral honours, which are now paid her come to
just nothing too.&nbsp; But the dead it seems must have their
vanities, and their holidays as well as the living.&nbsp; Alas!
what&rsquo;s a carcass but the most odious sort of
putrefaction?&nbsp; A corrupted earth, fit neither for fruit nor
tillage.&nbsp; And then for the sad looks of the mourners: they
are only troubled at the invitation; and would not care a pin, if
the inviter and body too were both at the devil.&nbsp; And that
you <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>might see by their behaviour, and discourses; for when
they should have been praying for the dead, they were prating of
her pedigree, and her last will and testament.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not so near akin,&rsquo; says one, &lsquo;but I
might have been spared; and I had twenty other things to
do.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another should have met company at a tavern; a
third, at a play.&nbsp; A fourth mutters that he is not placed
according to his quality.&nbsp; Another cries out, &lsquo;A pox
o&rsquo; your meetings where there is nothing stirring but
worms&rsquo; meat.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let me tell ye further, that the
widower himself is not grieved as you imagine for the dead wife;
but for the damned expense in blacks, and scutcheons, tapers, and
mourners; and that she was not fairly laid to rest, without all
this ado: for he persuades himself, that she might have found the
way to her grave without a candle.&nbsp; And since she was to
die, &rsquo;tis his opinion, that she should have made quicker
work on&rsquo;t: for a good wife is (like a good Christian) to
put her conscience in order betimes, and get her gone; without
lingering in the hands of doctors, &rsquo;pothecaries, and
surgeons, to murder her husband too.&nbsp; Or (to save charges)
she might have had the discretion to have died of the plague,
which would have staved off company.&nbsp; <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>This is the
second wife he has already turned over, and (to give the man his
due) he has had the wit to secure himself of a third, while this
lay on her deathbed.&nbsp; So that his case is no more than
chopping of a cold wife for a warm one, and he&rsquo;ll recover
this affliction, I warrant ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good man, methought, spoke wonders; and being thoroughly
convinced of the danger of trusting to appearances, I took up a
resolution, never to conclude upon anything, though never so
plausible, without due examination and inquiry.&nbsp; With that,
the funeral vanished, leaving us behind; and for a farewell, this
sentence: &ldquo;I am gone before, you are to follow; and in the
meantime, to accompany others to their graves, as you have done
me; and as I, when time was, have attended many others, with as
little care and devotion as yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were taken off from this meditation by a noise we heard in
a house behind us, where we had no sooner set foot over the
threshold, but we were entertained with a concert of six voices,
that were set and tuned to the sighs and groans of a woman newly
become a widow.&nbsp; The passion was acted to the life; but the
dead little the <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>better for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; They would be ever and anon
clapping and wringing of their hands; groaning and sighing, as if
their hearts would break.&nbsp; The hangings, pictures, and
furniture were all taken down and removed; the rooms hung with
black, and in one of them lay the poor disconsolate upon a couch
with her condoling friends about her.&nbsp; It was as dark as
pitch, and so much the better, for the parts they had to play;
for there was no discovering of the horrid faces and strains they
made, to fetch up their artificial tears and lamentations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;tears are but thrown away;
and really the grief to see your ladyship in this condition has
made me as lost a woman to all thought of comfort as
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I beseech you, madam, cheer
up,&rdquo; cries another, with almost as many sighs as words,
&ldquo;your husband&rsquo;s e&rsquo;en happy that he is out of
this miserable world.&nbsp; He was a good man, and now he finds
the sweet on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Patience, patience,
dear madam,&rdquo; cries a third, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis the will of
Heaven, and there&rsquo;s no contending.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dost
talk of patience,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;and no
contending?&nbsp; Wretched creature that I am! to outlive that
dear man!&nbsp; Oh that dear husband of mine!&nbsp; Oh that I <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>should ever
live to see this day!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she fell to
blubbering, sobbing, and raving a thousand times worse than
before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas, alas, who will trouble himself with a
poor widow!&nbsp; I have never a friend left to look after me;
what shall become of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this pause came in the chorus with their nose-instruments;
and there was such blowing, snobbing, snivelling, and throwing
snot about, that there was no enduring the house.&nbsp; And all
this, you must know, served them to a double purpose; that is to
say, for physic and for complement: for it passed for the
condoling office, and purged their heads of ill humours all under
one.&nbsp; I could not choose but compassionate the poor widow, a
creature forsaken of all the world; and I told my guide as much;
and that a charity (as I thought) would be well bestowed upon
her.&nbsp; The Holy Writ calls them mutes, according to the
import of the Hebrew: in regard that they have nobody to speak
for them.&nbsp; And if at any time they take heart to speak for
themselves, they had e&rsquo;en as good hold their tongues, for
nobody minds them.&nbsp; Is there anything more frequently given
in charge throughout the whole Bible, than to protect <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>the
fatherless, and defend the cause of the widow? as the highest and
most necessary point of Christian charity: in regard that they
have neither power, nor right to defend themselves.&nbsp; Does
not Job in the depth of his misery and disgraces make choice to
clear himself toward the widow, upon his expostulations with the
Almighty?&nbsp; [If I have caused the eyes of the widow to fail]
(or consumed the eyes of the widow; after the Hebrew) so that it
seems to me, beside the general duty of charity, we are also
bound by the laws of honour and generosity to assist them: for
the poor souls are fain to plead with their eyes, and beg with
their eyes, for want of either hands or tongues to help
themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed you must pardon me my good
father,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I cannot hold any longer from
bearing a part in this mournful concert, upon this sad
occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And is this,&rdquo; quoth the old
man, &ldquo;the fruit of your boasted divinity? to sink into
weakness and tears, when you have the greatest need of your
resolution and prudence.&nbsp; Have but a little patience, and
I&rsquo;ll unfold you this mystery; though (let me tell ye)
&rsquo;tis one of the hardest things in nature, to make any man
as wise as he should be, that conceits himself <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>wise enough
already.&nbsp; If this accident of the widow had not happened, we
had had none of the fine things that have been started
upon&rsquo;t: for &rsquo;tis occasion that awakens both our
virtue and philosophy; and &rsquo;tis not enough to know the mine
where the treasure lies, unless a man has the skill of drawing it
out, and making the best of what he has in his possession.&nbsp;
What are you the better for all the advantages of wit and
learning, without the faculty of reducing what you know into apt
and proper applications?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe me now, and I will show you that this widow
that looks as if she had nothing in her mouth but the service for
the dead, and only hallelujahs in her soul, that this mortified
piece of formality has green thoughts under her black veil, and
brisk imaginations about her, in despite of her calamity and
misfortune.&nbsp; The chamber you see is dark; and their faces
are muffled up in their funeral dresses.&nbsp; And what of all
this? when the whole course of their mourning is but a thorough
cheat.&nbsp; Their weeping signifies nothing more, than crying,
at so much an hour; for their tears are hackneyed out, and when
they have wept out their stage, they take up, and are
quiet.&nbsp; If you <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>would relieve them, leave them to
themselves; and as soon as your back is turned, you shall have
them singing and dancing, and as merry as Greeks: for take away
the spectators, their hypocrisy is at an end, and the play is
done; and now the confidents&rsquo; game begins.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, come, madam, &rsquo;faith we must be merry&rsquo;
cries one, &lsquo;we are to live by the living, and not by the
dead.&nbsp; For a bonny young widow as you are, to lie whimpering
away your opportunities and lose so many brave matches!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s, you know who, I dare swear, has a month&rsquo;s
mind to you; by my troth I would you were in bed together, and
I&rsquo;d be hanged, if you did not find one warm bedfellow worth
twenty cold ones.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Really, madam,&rsquo; cries
a second, &lsquo;she gives you good counsel; and if I were in
your place, I&rsquo;d follow it, and make use of my time.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis but one lost, and ten found.&nbsp; Pray&rsquo;e tell
me, madam, if I may be so bold; what&rsquo;s your opinion of that
cavalier that was here yesterday?&nbsp; Certainly he has a great
deal of wit; and methinks he&rsquo;s a very handsome proper
gentleman.&nbsp; Well! if that man has not a strange passion for
you, I&rsquo;ll never believe my eyes again for his sake; and, in
good faith, if all parties were agreed, I would <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>you were
e&rsquo;en well in his arms the night before to-morrow.&nbsp;
Were it not a burning shame to let such a beauty lie
fallow?&rsquo;&nbsp; This sets the widow a-pinking, and simpering
like a furmety-kettle; at length she makes up the pretty little
mouth, and says, &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis somewhat of the soonest to
talk of those affairs; but let it be as Heaven pleases.&nbsp;
However, madam, I am much beholden to you for your friendly
advice.&rsquo;&nbsp; You have here the very bottom of her sorrow:
she has taken a second husband into her heart before her first
was in his grave.&nbsp; I should have told you that your right
widow eats and drinks more the first day of her widowhood than in
any other of her whole life: for there appears not a visitant,
but presently out comes the groaning cake, a cold baked meat, or
some restorative morsel or other, to comfort the afflicted; and
the cordial bottle must not be forgotten neither, for
sorrow&rsquo;s dry.&nbsp; So to&rsquo;t they fall, and at every
bit or gulp, the lady relict fetches ye up a heavy sigh, pretends
to chew false, and makes protestation that for her part she can
taste nothing; she has quite lost her digestion; and has such an
oppression in her stomach that she dares not eat any more, for
fear of over-charging nature.&nbsp; &lsquo;And in truth,&rsquo;
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>says
she, &lsquo;how can it be otherwise; since (unhappy creature that
I am!) he is gone that gave the relish to all my enjoyments; but
there is no recalling him from the grave, and so, no remedy but
patience.&rsquo;&nbsp; By this time, you see,&rdquo; quoth the
old man, &ldquo;whether your exclamations were reasonable, or
no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth, when hearing an uproar
among the rabble in the street, we looked out to see what was the
matter.&nbsp; And there we saw a catchpole, without either hat or
band, out of breath, and his face all bloody, crying out,
&ldquo;Help, help, in the king&rsquo;s name! stop thief, stop
thief!&rdquo; and all the while, running as hard as he could
drive, after a thief that made away from him, as if the devil had
been at his breech.&nbsp; After him, came an attorney, all dirty,
a world of papers in his hand, an inkhorn at his girdle, and a
crowd of nasty people about him; and down he sat himself just
before us, to write somewhat upon his knee.&nbsp; Bless me
(thought I) how a cause prospers in the hand of one of these
fellows, for he had filled his paper in a trice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These catchpoles,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;had need to be
well paid, for the hazards they run to secure us in our lives and
fortunes; and indeed they <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>deserve it.&nbsp; Look how the poor
wretch is torn, bruised, and battered, and all this for the good
and benefit of the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soft and fair,&rdquo; quoth the old man; &ldquo;I think
thou wouldst never leave talking, if I did not stop thy mouth
sometime.&nbsp; You must know, that he that made the escape and
the catchpole are a couple of ancient friends and
pot-companions.&nbsp; Now the catchpole quarrels the thief for
not giving him a snip in the last booty; and the thief, after a
great struggle, and a good lusty rubber at cuffs, has made a
shift to save himself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll say the rogue had need
of good heels, to outrun this gallows-beagle; for there&rsquo;s
hardly any beast will outstrip a bailiff that runs upon the view
of a quarry.&nbsp; So that there&rsquo;s not the least thought of
a public good in the catchpole&rsquo;s action; but merely a
prosecution of his own profit, and a spite to see himself
choused.&nbsp; Now if the catchpole, I confess, without any
private interest had made this attempt upon the thief, (being his
friend) to bring him to justice, it had been well; and yet, take
this along with you: it is as natural to let slip a serjeant at a
pickpocket as a greyhound at a hare.&nbsp; The whip, the pillory,
the axe, and the halter make up the best part of the
catchpole&rsquo;s <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>revenue.&nbsp; These people are of all sorts the most
odious to the world; and if men in revenge would resolve to be
virtuous, though but for a year or two, they might starve them
all.&nbsp; It is in fine an unlucky employment, and catchpoles as
well as the devils themselves have the wages of
tormentors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said I to my guide, &ldquo;that the
attorneys shall have your good word too.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
yes, ye need not doubt it,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;for
your attorney and your catchpole always hunt in couples.&nbsp;
The attorney draws the information, and has all his forms ready,
so that &rsquo;tis no more then but to fill up the blanks, and
away to the jail with the delinquent; if there be anything to be
gotten &rsquo;tis not a halfpenny matter, whether the party be
guilty or innocent: give but an attorney pen, ink, and paper, and
let him alone for witnesses.&nbsp; In case of an examination, he
has the grace not to insist too much upon plain and naked truth;
but to set down only what makes for his purpose, and then when
they come to signing, to read over in the deponent&rsquo;s sense
(for his memory is good) what he has written in his own; and by
this means, the cause goes on as he pleases.&nbsp; To prevent
this villainy, it <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>were well, if the examiners were as well sworn to write
the truth as the witnesses are to speak it.&nbsp; And yet there
are some honest men of all sorts but among the attorneys; the
very calling does by the honest catchpoles, marshal&rsquo;s men,
and their fellows, as the sea by the dead: it may entertain them
for a while, but in a very short space it spews them up
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good man would have proceeded, if he had not been taken
off by the rattling of a gilt coach, wherein was a courtier that
was blown up as big as pride and vanity could make him.&nbsp; He
sat stiff and upright, as if he had swallowed a stake; and made
it his glory to show himself in that posture: it would have hurt
his eyes, to have exchanged a glance with anything that was
vulgar, and therefore he was very sparing of his looks.&nbsp; He
had a deep laced ruff on, that was right Spanish, which he wore
erect, and stiff starched, that a man would have thought he had
carried his head in a paper-lanthorn.&nbsp; He was a great
studier of set faces, and much affected with looking politic and
big.&nbsp; But, for his arms and body, he had utterly lost or
forgotten the use of them: for he could neither bow nor move his
hat to any man that saluted him; no, nor so much as turn <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>from one
side to the other; but sat as if he had been boxed up, like a
Bartlemew-baby.&nbsp; After this magnificent statue, followed a
swarm of gaudy butterfly-lackeys: and his lordship&rsquo;s
company in the coach was a buffoon and a parasite.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh blessed prince!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to live at this
rate of ease and splendour, and to have the world at will!&nbsp;
What a glorious train is that!&nbsp; Beyond all doubt, there
never was a great fortune better bestowed.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
that, the old man took me up, and told me that the judgment I had
made upon this occasion, from one end to the other, was all
dotage and mistake; save only, when I said he had the world at
will: &ldquo;and in that,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you have reason;
for what is the world but labour, vanity, and folly; which is
likewise the composition and entertainment of this cavalier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the train that follows him let it be examined,
and my life for yours, you shall find more creditors in&rsquo;t,
than servants: there are bankers, jewellers, scriveners, brokers,
mercers, drapers, tailors, vintners; and these are properly the
stays and supporters of this animated machine.&nbsp; The money,
meat, drink, robes, liveries, wages, all comes out of their
pockets; they have this honour for their security; <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>and must
content themselves with promises, and fair words for full
satisfaction, unless they had rather have a footman with a cudgel
for their pay-master.&nbsp; And after all, if this gallant were
taken to shrift, or that a man could enter into the secrets of
his conscience, I dare undertake, it would appear that he that
digs in a mine for his bread lives ten thousand times more at
ease than the other, with beating of his brains night and day for
new shifts, tricks and projects to keep himself above water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe his companions now, his fool and his
flatterer.&nbsp; They are too hard for him, ye see; and eat,
drink, and make merry at his expense.&nbsp; What greater misery
or shame in the world, than for a man to make a friendship with
such rascals, and to spend his time and estate in so brutal, and
insipid a society!&nbsp; It costs him more (beside his credit) to
maintain that couple of coxcombs than would have bought him the
conversation of a brace of grave and learned philosophers.&nbsp;
But will ye now see the bottom of this scandalous and
dishonourable kindness?&nbsp; &lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; says the
buffoon, &lsquo;you were most infallibly wrapt in your
mother&rsquo;s smock; for let me be &mdash; if ye have not set
all the ladies about the court agog.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>very truth
is,&rsquo; cries the parasite, &lsquo;all the rest of the
nobility look like corn-cutters to you; and indeed, wherever you
come, you have still the eyes of the whole company upon
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Go to, go to, gentlemen,&rsquo; says my
lord, &lsquo;you must not flatter your friends.&nbsp; This is
more your courtesy than my desert; and I have an obligation to
you for your kindness.&rsquo;&nbsp; After this manner these asses
knab and curry one another, and play the fools by
turns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man had his words yet between his teeth, when there
passed just by us a lady of pleasure, of so excellent a shape and
garb, that it was impossible to see her without a passion for
her, and no less impossible to look upon anything else, so long
as she was to be seen.&nbsp; They that had seen her once were to
see her no more, for she turned her face still to
new-comers.&nbsp; Her motion was graceful and free.&nbsp; One
while she&rsquo;d stare ye full in the eyes, under colour of
opening her hood, to set it in better order.&nbsp; By and by
she&rsquo;d steal a look at ye with one eye, and a side face,
from the corner of her visor, like a witch that&rsquo;s afraid to
be known when she comes from a caterwaul.&nbsp; And then out
comes the delicate hand, and discovers the more delicious neck,
and breasts, to adjust the handkercher <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>or the
scarf, or to remove some other grievance that made her ladyship
uneasy.&nbsp; Her hair was most artificially disposed into
careless rings; and the best red and white in nature was in her
cheeks, if that of her lips and teeth did not exceed it.&nbsp; In
a word, all she looked upon was her own; and this was the vision
for my money, from all the rest.&nbsp; As she was marching off, I
could not choose but take up a resolution to follow her.&nbsp;
But my old man laid a block in the way, and stopped me at the
very starting; which was an affront to a man that was both in
love and in haste, that might very well stir his choler.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My officious friend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he that does
not love a woman sucked a sow.&nbsp; And questionless, he must be
either blind or barbarous that&rsquo;s proof against the charms
of so divine a beauty.&nbsp; Nor would any but a sot let slip the
blessed opportunity of so fair an encounter.&nbsp; A handsome
woman? why, what was she made for, but to be loved?&nbsp; And he
that has her, has all that&rsquo;s lovely or desirable in
nature.&nbsp; For my own part, I would renounce the world for the
fellow of her, and never desire anything either beyond her, or
beside her.&nbsp; What lightning does she carry in her
eyes!&nbsp; What charms, and <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>chains in her looks, and motions,
for the very souls of her beholders!&nbsp; Was ever anything so
clear as her forehead? or so black as her eyebrows?&nbsp; One
would swear that her complexion had taken a tincture of vermilion
and milk: and that nature had brought her into the world with
pearl and rubies in her mouth.&nbsp; To speak all in little,
she&rsquo;s the masterpiece of the creation, worthy of infinite
praise, and equal to our largest desires and
imaginations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the old man cut me short, and bade me make an end of my
discourse, &ldquo;for thou art,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a man of
much wonder, and small experience, and delivered over to the
spirit of folly and blindness.&nbsp; Thou hast thy eyes in thy
head, and yet not brain enough to know either why they were given
thee, or how to use them.&nbsp; Understand then that the office
of the eye is to see, but &rsquo;tis the privilege of the soul to
distinguish and choose, whereas you either do the contrary, or
else nothing, which is worse.&nbsp; He that trusts his eyes,
exposes his mind to a thousand torments and confusions: he shall
take clouds for mountains, straight for crooked, one colour for
another, by reason of an undue distance, or an indisposed
medium.&nbsp; We are not able sometimes to say which way <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>a river
runs, till we throw in a twig or straw to find out the
current.&nbsp; And what will you say now, if this prodigious
beauty, your new mistress, prove as gross a cheat and imposture
as any of the rest?&nbsp; She went to bed last night as ugly as a
witch; and yet this morning she comes forth in your opinion as
glorious as an angel.&nbsp; The truth of it is, she hires all by
the day; and if you did but see this puppet taken to pieces, you
would find her little else but paint and plaister.&nbsp; To begin
her anatomy at the head.&nbsp; You must know that the hair she
wears is borrowed of a tire-woman, for her own was blown off by
an unlucky wind from the coast of Naples.&nbsp; Or if she has any
left, she keeps it private, as a memorial of her antiquity.&nbsp;
She is beholden to the pencil for her eyebrows and
complexion.&nbsp; And upon the whole matter, she is but an old
picture refreshed.&nbsp; But the wonder is, to see a picture,
with life and motion; unless perchance she has got the
necromancer&rsquo;s receipt that made himself young again in his
glass bottle.&nbsp; For all that you see of her that&rsquo;s
good, comes from distilled waters, essences, powders, and the
like; and to see the washing of her face would fright the
devil.&nbsp; She abounds in pomanders, sweet waters, <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Spanish
pockets, perfumed drawers; and all little enough to qualify the
poisonous whiffs she sends from her toes and arm-pits, which
would otherwise out-stink ten thousand pole-cats.&nbsp; She
cannot choose but kiss well, for her lips are perpetually bathed
in oil and grease.&nbsp; And he that embraces her, shall find the
better half of her the tailor&rsquo;s, and only a stuffing of
cotton and canvas, to supply the defects of her body.&nbsp; When
she goes to bed, she puts off one half of her person with her
shoes.&nbsp; What do ye think of your adored beauty now? or have
your eyes betrayed ye?&nbsp; Well, well; confess your error and
mend it; and know that (without more descant upon this woman)
&rsquo;tis the design and glory of most of the sex to lead silly
men captive.&nbsp; Nay take the best of them, and what with the
trouble of getting them and the difficulty of pleasing them, he
that comes off best will find himself a loser at the foot of the
account.&nbsp; I could recommend you here to other remedies of
love, inseparable from the very sex, but what I have said
already, I hope, will be sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">THE END OF THE FIFTH VISION</p>
<h2><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>THE
SIXTH VISION OF HELL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> one autumn at a
friend&rsquo;s house in the country (which was indeed a most
delicious retreat) I took a walk one moonlight night into the
park, where all my past visions came fresh into my head again,
and I was well enough pleased with the meditation.&nbsp; At
length the humour took me to leave the path, and go further into
the wood: what impulse carried me to this, I know not.&nbsp;
Whether I was moved by my good angel, or some higher power, but
so it was that in half a quarter of an hour, I found myself a
great way from home, and in a place where &rsquo;twas no longer
night; with the pleasantest prospect round about me that ever I
saw since I was born.&nbsp; The air was calm and temperate; and
it was no small advantage to the beauty of the place, that it was
both innocent and silent.&nbsp; On the one hand, I was
entertained <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>with the murmurs of crystal rivulets; on the other,
with the whispering of the trees; the birds singing all the while
either in emulation, or requital of the other harmonies.&nbsp;
And now, to show the instability of our affections and desires, I
was grown weary even of tranquillity itself, and in this most
agreeable solitude began to long for company.</p>
<p>When in the very instant (to my great wonder) I discovered two
paths, issuing from one and the same beginning but dividing
themselves forwards, more and more, by degrees, as if they liked
not one another&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; That on the right hand was
narrow, almost beyond imagination; and being very little
frequented, it was so overgrown with thorns and brambles, and so
stony withal, that a man had all the trouble in the world to get
into&rsquo;t.&nbsp; One might see, however, the prints and marks
of several passengers that had rubbed through, though with
exceeding difficulty; for they had left pieces of heads, arms,
legs, feet, and many of them their whole skins behind them.&nbsp;
Some we saw yet upon the way, pressing forward, without ever so
much as looking back; and these were all of them pale-faced,
lean, thin, and miserably mortified.&nbsp; There was <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>no passing
for horsemen; and I was told that St. Paul himself left his
horse, when he went into&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And indeed, there was not
the footing of any beast to be seen.&nbsp; Neither horse nor
mule, nor the track of any coach or chariot.&nbsp; Nor could I
learn that any had passed that way in the memory of man.&nbsp;
While I was bethinking myself of what I had seen, I spied at
length a beggar that was resting himself a little to take breath;
and I asked him what inns or lodgings they had upon that
road.&nbsp; His answer was that there was no stopping there, till
they came to their journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the way to paradise, and what
should they do with inns or taverns, where there are so few
passengers?&nbsp; Do not you know that in the course of nature,
to die is to be born, to live is to travel; and the world is but
a great inn, after which, it is but one stage either to pain or
glory?&rdquo;&nbsp; And with these words he marched forward, and
bade me God-b&rsquo;w&rsquo;ye, telling me withal that it was
time lost to linger in the way of virtue, and not safe to
entertain such dialogues as tend rather to curiosity than
instruction.&nbsp; And so he pursued his journey, stumbling,
tearing his flesh, and sighing, and groaning at every step; and
weeping as if he thought <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>to soften the stones with his
tears.&nbsp; This is no way for me, thought I to myself; and no
company neither; for they are a sort of beggarly, morose people,
and will never agree with my humour.&nbsp; So I drew back and
struck off into the left-hand way.</p>
<p>And there I found company enough and room for more.&nbsp; What
a world of brave cavaliers!&nbsp; Gilt coaches, rich liveries,
and handsome, lively lasses, as glorious as the sun!&nbsp; Some
were singing and laughing, others tickling one another and
toying; some again, at their cheese-cakes and China oranges, or
appointing a set at cards: so that taking all together, I durst
have sworn I had been at the park.&nbsp; This minded me of the
old saying, &ldquo;Tell me thy company, and I&rsquo;ll tell thee
thy manners;&rdquo; and to save the credit of my education, I put
myself into the noble mode, and jogged on.&nbsp; And there was I
at the first dash up to the ears, in balls, plays, masquerades,
collations, dalliances, amours, and as full of joy as my heart
could hold.</p>
<p>It was not here, as upon t&rsquo;other road, where folks went
barefoot and naked, for want of shoemakers and tailors, for here
were enow, and to spare; beside mercers, drapers, jewellers,
bodice-makers, peruke-makers, milliners, and a French ordinary <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>at every
other door.&nbsp; You cannot imagine the pleasure I took in my
new acquaintance; and yet there was now and then some justling
and disorder upon the way, chiefly between the physicians upon
their mules, and the infantry of the lawyers, that marched in
great bodies before the judges, and contested for place.&nbsp;
But the physicians carried it in favour of their charter, which
gives them privilege to study, practise, and teach the art of
poisoning, and to read lectures of it in the universities.&nbsp;
While this point of honour was in dispute, I perceived divers
crossing from one way to the other, and changing of
parties.&nbsp; Some of them stumbled and recovered; others fell
down right.&nbsp; But the pleasantest gambol of all was that of
the vintners.&nbsp; A whole litter of them tumbled into a pit
together, one over another, but finding they were out of their
element, they got up again as fast as they could.&nbsp; Those
that were in the right-hand way, which was the way of paradise,
or virtue, advanced very heavily, and made us excellent
sport.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prithee look what a Friday-face that fellow
makes!&rdquo; cries one; &ldquo;Hang him, prick-eared cur,&rdquo;
says another; &ldquo;Damn me,&rdquo; cries a third, &ldquo;if the
rogue be not drunk with holy water;&rdquo; <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>&ldquo;If
the devil had raked hell, he could not have found such a pack of
ill-looked rascals,&rdquo; says another.&nbsp; Some of them
stopped their ears, and went on without minding us.&nbsp; Others
we put out of countenance, and they came over to us.&nbsp; And a
third sort came out of pure love to our company.</p>
<p>After this, I observed a great many people afar off in a
by-path: with as much contrition and devotion in their looks and
gestures as ever I saw in men.&nbsp; They walked shaking their
heads, and lifting up their hands to heaven; and they had most of
them large ears, and, to my thinking, Geneva Bibles.&nbsp; These,
thought I, are a people of singular integrity, and strictness of
life, above their fellows; but coming nearer, we found them to be
hypocrites; and that though they&rsquo;d none of our company upon
the road, they would not fail to meet us at our journey&rsquo;s
end.&nbsp; Fasting, repentance, prayer, mortification, and other
holy duties, which are the exercise of good Christians, in order
to their salvation, are but a kind of probation to these men, to
fit them for the devil.&nbsp; They were followed by a number of
devotees, and holy sisters, that kissed the skirts of their
garments all the way they went, but whether out of zeal,
spiritual, or natural, <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>is hard to say; and undoubtedly,
some women&rsquo;s kisses are worse than Judas&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For
though his kiss was treacherous in the intention, it was right
yet in the application: but this was one Judas kissing another,
which makes me think there was more of the flesh than of the
spirit in the case.&nbsp; Some would be drawing a thread now and
then out of the holy man&rsquo;s garment, to make a relic
of.&nbsp; Others would cut out large snips, as if they had a mind
to see them naked.&nbsp; Some again desired they would remember
them in their prayers; which was just as much as if they had
commended themselves to the devil by a third person.&nbsp; Some
prayed for good matches for their daughters; others begged
children for themselves: and sure the husband that allows his
wife to ask children abroad will be so civil as to take them
home, when they are given him.&nbsp; In fine, these hypocrites
may for a while perchance impose upon the world, and delude the
multitude; but no mask or disguise is proof against the
all-piercing eye of the Almighty.&nbsp; There are I must confess
many religious and godly men, for whose persons and prayers I
have a great esteem.&nbsp; But these are not of the
hypocrites&rsquo; humour, to build their hopes and ambition upon
<a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>popular
applause, and with a counterfeit humility, to proclaim their
weakness and unworthiness; their failings; yea and their
transgressions in the market-place; all which is indeed but a
true jest; for they are really what they say, though they would
not be thought so.</p>
<p>These went apart, and were looked upon to be neither fish nor
flesh nor good red-herring.&nbsp; They wore the name of
Christians; but they had neither the wit nor the honesty of
pagans.&nbsp; For they content themselves with the pleasures of
this life, because they know no better.&nbsp; But the hypocrite,
that&rsquo;s instructed both in the life temporal and eternal,
lives without either comfort in the one, or hope in the other;
and takes more pains to be damned than a good Christian does to
compass his salvation.&nbsp; In short, we went on our way in
discourse.&nbsp; The rich followed their wealth, and the poor the
rich; begging there what Providence had denied them.&nbsp; The
stubborn and obstinate went away by themselves, for they would
hear nobody that was wiser than themselves, but ran huddling on,
and pressed still to be foremost.&nbsp; The magistrates drew
after them all the solicitors and attorneys.&nbsp; Corrupt judges
were carried away by passion and <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>avarice.&nbsp; And vain and
ambitious princes trailed along with them principalities and
commonwealths.&nbsp; There were a world of clergy upon this road
too.&nbsp; And I saw one full regiment of soldiers there, which
would have been brave fellows indeed, if they had but been half
so good at praying and fighting, as they were at swearing.&nbsp;
Their whole discourse was of their adventures, how narrowly they
came off at such an assault; what wounds they received upon
t&rsquo;other breach; and then what a destruction they made at
such a time, of mutton and poultry.&nbsp; But all they said came
in at one ear and went out at t&rsquo;other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, sirrah,&rdquo; says one,
&ldquo;how we clawed it away at such a place!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, ye damned rogue you,&rdquo; cries t&rsquo;other,
&ldquo;when you were so drunk you took your aunt for the
bawd.&rdquo;&nbsp; These and such as these were the only exploits
they could truly brag of.</p>
<p>While they were upon these glorious rhodomontades, certain
generous spirits from the right-hand way, that knew what they
were, by the boxes of passports, testimonials, and
recommendations they wore at their girdles, cried out to them, as
if it had been to an attack: &ldquo;Fall on, fall on, my lads,
and follow me.&nbsp; This, this is the path of honour, and if you
were not <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>poltroons you would not quit it for fear of a hard
march, or an ill lodging.&nbsp; Courage comrades; and be assured
that this combat well fought makes all your fortunes, and crowns
ye for ever.&nbsp; Here, ye shall be sure both of pay and reward,
without casting the issue of all your hazards and hopes upon the
empty promises of princes.&nbsp; How long will ye pursue this
trade of blood and rapine?&nbsp; And accustom your ears and
tongues to the tragical outcries of, Burn; No quarter; Kill, or
Die.&nbsp; It is not pay, or pillage, but Virtue that&rsquo;s a
brave man&rsquo;s recompense.&nbsp; Trust to her, and
she&rsquo;ll not deceive ye.&nbsp; If it be the war ye love, come
to us; bear arms on the right side, and we&rsquo;ll find you
work.&nbsp; Do not you know that man&rsquo;s life is a
warfare?&nbsp; That the world, the flesh, and the devil, are
three vigilant enemies?&nbsp; And that it is as much as his soul
is worth, to put himself, but for one minute, out of his
guard.&nbsp; Princes tell ye, that your bloods and your lives are
theirs, and that to shed the one, and lose the other, in their
service, is no obligation, but a duty.&nbsp; You are still
however to look to the cause; wherefore turn head, and come along
with us, and be happy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The soldiers heard all this
with exceeding patience and attention; but the <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>brand of
cowardice had such an effect upon them, that without any more
ado, like men of honour, they presently quitted the road; drew;
and as bold as lions, charged headlong into a tavern.</p>
<p>After this, we saw a great troop of women, upon the highway to
hell, with their bags and their fellows, at their heels, ever and
anon hunching and justling one another.&nbsp; On the other side,
a number of good people, that were almost at the end of their
journey, came over into the wrong road; for the right-hand way
growing easier and wider toward the end, and that on the left
hand, on the contrary, narrower, they thought they had been out
of their way, and so came in to us; as many of ours went over to
them, upon the same mistake.&nbsp; Among the rest, I saw a great
lady, without either coach, sedan, or any living creature with
her, foot it all the way to hell: which was to me so great a
wonder, considering how she had lived in the world, that I
presently looked about for a public notary to make an entry of
it.&nbsp; The woman was in a most miserable pickle; and I did not
know what design she might drive on, under that disguise; but
finding never a notary, or register at hand, though I missed my
particular aim, yet I was well <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>enough pleased with it, for I took
it then for granted that I was in my ready way to heaven.&nbsp;
But when I came afterward to reflect upon the crosses,
afflictions, and mortifications, that lie in the way to paradise;
and to consider that there was nothing of that upon this road;
but on the contrary, laughing, singing, frollicking, and all
manner of jollity: this I must confess gave me a qualm, and made
me a little doubtful whither I was going.</p>
<p>But I was quickly delivered of that doubt by a gang of married
men, that we overtook with their wives in their hands, in
evidence of their mortifications: &ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s my
witness,&rdquo; cries one, &ldquo;that every day since I married
her has been a fasting day to me; to pamper her with cock-broth,
and jellies.&nbsp; And my wife knows how I have humbled my body
by nakedness; for I have hardly allowed myself a rag to my
backside; or a shoe to my foot, to maintain her in her coach,
pages, gowns, petticoats, and jewels.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that upon
the matter, I perceive an unlucky hit with a wife gives a man as
much right to the catalogue of martyrs, as if he had ended his
days at the stake.</p>
<p>The misery these poor wretches endured made me think myself in
the right again; <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>till I heard a cry behind me, &ldquo;Make way there;
make way for the &rsquo;pothecaries.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bless me,
thought I, if they be here, we are certainly going to the
devil.&nbsp; And so it proved, for we were just then come to a
little door, that was made like a mousetrap, where &rsquo;twas
easy to get in, but there was no getting out again.</p>
<p>It was a strange thing, that scarce anybody so much as dreamt
of hell, all the way we went; and yet everybody knew where they
were, as soon as they came there; and cried out with one voice,
&ldquo;Miserable creatures! we are damned, we are
damned.&rdquo;&nbsp; That word made my heart ache; and is it come
to that? said I.&nbsp; Then did I begin with tears in my eyes to
reflect upon what I had left in the world, as my relations,
friends, ladies, mistresses, and in fine, all my old
acquaintance: when with a heavy sigh, looking behind me, I saw
the greater part of them posting after me.&nbsp; It gave me,
methought, some comfort, that I should have so good company;
vainly imagining that even hell itself might be capable of some
relief.</p>
<p>Going farther on I was gotten into a crowd of tailors, that
stood up sneaking in a corner, for fear of the devils.&nbsp; At
the first door, there were seven devils, taking <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>the names
of those that came in; and they asked me mine, and my quality,
and so they let me pass.&nbsp; But, examining the tailors,
&ldquo;These fellows,&rdquo; cried one of the devils, &ldquo;come
in such shoals, as if hell were made only for
tailors.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How many are they?&rdquo; says
another.&nbsp; Answer was made, &ldquo;About a
hundred.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;About a hundred?&nbsp; They must be
more than a hundred,&rdquo; says t&rsquo;other, &ldquo;if they be
tailors; for they never come under a thousand, or twelve hundred
strong.&nbsp; And we have so many here already, I do not know
where we shall &rsquo;stow them.&nbsp; Say the word, my masters,
shall&rsquo;s let them in or no?&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor prick-lice
were damnedly startled at that, for fear they should not get in:
but in the end, they had the favour to be admitted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;these folks are but in an
ill condition, when &rsquo;tis a menace for the devils themselves
to refuse to receive them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon a huge,
overgrown, club-footed, crump-shouldered devil, threw them all
into a deep hole.&nbsp; Seeing such a monster of a devil, I asked
him how he came to be so deformed.&nbsp; And he told me, he had
spoiled his back with carrying of tailors: &ldquo;for,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I have been formerly made use of as a sumpter to
fetch them; but now of late they save me that labour, and come <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>so fast of
themselves, that &rsquo;tis one devil&rsquo;s work to dispose of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; While the word was yet speaking, there came
another glut of them, and I was fain to make way, that the devil
might have room to work in, who piled them up, and told me they
made the best fuel in hell.</p>
<p>I passed forward then into a little dark alley, where it made
me start to hear one call me by my name, and with much ado I
perceived a fellow there all wrapt up in smoke and flame.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alas! sir,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;have you forgotten your
old bookseller in Popes-Head Alley?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I cry
thee mercy, good Livowell,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;what? art thou
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis e&rsquo;en too true.&nbsp; I never dreamt it
would have come to this.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought I must needs
pity him, when I knew him: but truly I reflected rather upon the
justice of his punishment.&nbsp; For in a word, his shop was the
very mint of heresy, schism, and sedition.&nbsp; I put on a face
of compassion however, to give him a little ease, which he took
hold of, and vented his complaint.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well sir,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;I would my father had made me a hangman, when he
made me a stationer; for we are called to account for other
men&rsquo;s works, as well as for our own.&nbsp; And one thing
that&rsquo;s cast in our <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>dish, is the selling of
translations, so dog cheap, that every sot knows now as much as
would formerly have made a passable doctor, and every nasty groom
and roguey lackey is grown as familiar with Homer, Virgil, Ovid,
as if &rsquo;twere <i>Robin the Devil</i>, <i>The Seven
Champions</i>, or a piece of George Withers.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
would have talked on, if a devil had not stopped his mouth with a
whiff from a roll of his own papers, and choked him with the
smoke on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The pestilent fume would have dispatched
me too, if I had not got presently out of the reach
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I went my way, saying this to myself, If
the bookseller be thus criminal, what will become of the
author!</p>
<p>I was diverted from this meditation, by the rueful groans of a
great many souls that were under the lash, and the devil
tyrannising over them with whips and scourges.&nbsp; I asked what
they were, and it was told me, that there was a plot among the
hackney-coachmen to exhibit an information against the devils,
for taking the whip out of their hands, and setting up a trade
they had never served to, (which is directly contrary to
<i>Quinto Elizabeth&aelig;</i>).&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
I: &ldquo;but why are these tormented here?&rdquo;&nbsp; With
that, an old sour-looked coachman took the answer out of the
devil&rsquo;s <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>mouth, and told me, that it was because they came to
hell a horseback, which they pretended was a privilege that did
not belong to rogues of their quality.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak truth,
and be hanged,&rdquo; cried the devil; &ldquo;and make an honest
confession here.&nbsp; Say, sirrah, how many bawdy voyages have
you made to Hackney?&nbsp; How many nights have you stood pimping
at Marybone?&nbsp; How many whores and knaves have you brought
together?&nbsp; And how many lies have you told, to keep all
private, since you first set up this scandalous
trade?&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a coachman by, that had served a
judge, and thought &rsquo;twas no more for his old master to
fetch a rascal out of hell than out of Newgate; which made this
fellow stand upon his points, and ask the devil, how he durst
give that language to so honourable a profession;
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;who wears better clothes than
your coachmen?&nbsp; Are not we in our velvets, embroideries, and
laces? and as glorious as so many phaetons?&nbsp; Have not our
masters reason to be good to us, when their necks are at stake
and their lives at our mercy?&nbsp; Nay, we govern those, many
times, that govern kingdoms; and a prince is almost in as much
danger of his coachman as of his physician.&nbsp; And there are
that understand <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>it too, and themselves, and us; and that will not stick
to trust their coachmen as far as they would do their
confessors.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no absurdity in the comparison;
for if they know some of their privacies, we know more; yes, and
perhaps more than we&rsquo;ll speak of.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What
have we here to do?&rdquo; cried a devil that was ready to break
his heart with laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;A coachman in his tropes
and figures?&nbsp; An orator instead of a waggoner?&nbsp; The
slave has broke his bridle, and got his head at liberty, and now
he&rsquo;ll never have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, why should
he?&rdquo; says another that had served a great lady more ways
than one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this the best entertainment you can
afford your servants? your daily drudges?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure we
bring you good commodity, well packed; well conditioned; well
perfumed; right, neat, and clean: not like your city-ware that
comes dirty to you, up to the hocks; and yet every daggle-tailed
wench, and skip-kennel, shall be better used than we.&nbsp;
Ah!&nbsp; The ingratitude of this place!&nbsp; If we had done as
much for somebody else, as we have done for you, we should not
have been now to seek for our wages.&nbsp; When you have nothing
else to say, you tell me that I am punished for carrying the
sick, the gouty, the lame, <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>to church, to mass; or some
straggling virgins, back again to their cloister: which is a
damned lie; for I am able to prove, that all my trading lay at
the play-houses, bawdy-houses, taverns, balls, collations: or
else at the <i>Tour &agrave; la Mode</i>, where there was still
appointed some after-meeting; to treat of certain affairs, that
highly import the interest and welfare of your dominions.&nbsp; I
have indeed carried my mistress sometimes to the church door, but
it signified no more than if I had carried her to a conventicle;
for all her business there was to meet her gallant, and to agree
when they should meet next; according to the way of devotion now
in mode.&nbsp; To conclude: It is most certain, that I never took
any creature (knowingly) into my coach, that had so much as a
good thought.&nbsp; And this was so well known, that it was all
one to ask, If a lady were a maid, or if she had ever been in my
coach.&nbsp; If it appeared she had, he that married her knew
beforehand what he had to trust to.&nbsp; And after all this, ye
have made us a fair requital.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that the devil
fell a-laughing, and with five or six twinging jerks, half flayed
the poor coachman; so that I was e&rsquo;en glad to retire, in
pity partly to the coachman and partly to myself; <a

currying of a coachman is little better than the turning up of a
dunghill.</p>
<p>My next adventure was into a deep vault, where I began
immediately to shudder, and my teeth chattered in my head.&nbsp;
I asked the meaning of it; and there came up to me a devil, with
kibed heels and his toes all mortified; and told me that that
quarter was allotted to the buffoons and drolls, &ldquo;which are
a people,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;of so starved a conceipt, and so
cold a discourse, that we are fain to chain and lock them up, for
fear they should spoil the temper of our fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
asked if a man might see them.&nbsp; The devil told me yes, and
showed me one of the lewdest kennels in hell.&nbsp; And there
were they at it, pecking at one another, and nothing but the same
fooleries over and over again that they had practised upon
earth.&nbsp; Among the buffoons, I saw divers that passed here in
the world for men of honesty and honour; which were in, as the
devil told me, for flattery, and were a sort of buffoon, that
goes betwixt the bark and the tree.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, why are
they condemned?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;The other buffoons
are condemned,&rdquo; quoth the devil, &ldquo;for want of favour;
and these, for having too <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>much, and abusing it.&nbsp; You must
know, they come upon us, still at unawares; and yet they find all
things in readiness; the cloth laid, and the bed made, as if they
were at home.&nbsp; To say the truth, we have some sort of
kindness for them; for they save us a great deal of trouble, in
tormenting one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see him there?&nbsp; That was a wicked, and a
partial judge; and all he has to say for himself, is, that he
remembers the time when he could have broke the neck of two
honest causes, and he put them only out of joint.&nbsp; That good
fellow there was a careless husband, and him we lodge too with
the buffoons.&nbsp; He sold his wife&rsquo;s portion, wife and
all, to please his companions; and turned both into an
annuity.&nbsp; That lady there (though a great one) is fain to
take up too with the buffoons, for they are both of a humour:
what they do with their talk, she does with her body, and seasons
it to all appetites.&nbsp; In a word, you shall find buffoons in
all conditions; and, in effect, there are nigh as many as there
are men and women: for the whole world is given to jeering,
slandering, backbiting, and there are more natural buffoons than
artificial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At my going out of the vault, I saw a <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>matter of a
thousand devils following a drove of pastry-men, and breaking
their heads as they passed along, with iron peels.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alack!&rdquo; cried one of them, that was yet in a whole
skin, &ldquo;it is hard the sin of the flesh should be laid to
our charge, that never had to do with women.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Impudent, nasty rascals,&rdquo; quoth a devil, &ldquo;who
has deserved hell, if they have not?&nbsp; How many thousand men
have these slovens poisoned, with the grease of their heads and
tails, instead of mutton-suet? with snot-pies for marrow; and
flies for currants?&nbsp; How many stomachs have they turned into
lay-stalls with the dogs&rsquo;-flesh, horse-flesh and other
carrion that they have put into them?&nbsp; And do these rogues
complain (in the devil&rsquo;s name) of their sufferings!&nbsp;
Leave your bawling, ye whelps,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and know,
that the pain you endure is nothing to that of your
tormentors.&nbsp; And for your part,&rdquo; says he, to me, with
a sour look, &ldquo;because you are a stranger, you may go about
your business; but we have a crow to pluck with these fellows,
before we part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went next down a pair of stairs into a huge cellar, where I
saw men burning in unquenchable fire; and one of them roaring,
cried out, &ldquo;I never over-sold; I <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>never sold,
but at conscionable rates, why am I punished thus?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
durst have sworn it had been Judas, but going nearer to him, to
see if he had a red head, I found him to be a merchant of my
acquaintance, that died not long since.&nbsp; &ldquo;How now, old
Martin,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;art thou there?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
dogged, because I did not call him Sir, and made no answer.&nbsp;
I saw his grief, and told him how much he was to blame, to
cherish that vanity even in hell, that had brought him
thither.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what do ye think on&rsquo;t now,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;had not you better have traded in blacks than
Christians?&nbsp; Had not you better have contented yourself with
a little, honestly got, than run the hazard of your soul for an
estate; and have gone to heaven afoot, rather than to the devil
on horseback?&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend was as mute as a fish;
whether out of anger, shame, or grief, I know not.&nbsp; And then
a devil in office took up the discourse.&nbsp; &ldquo;These
pickpocket rogues,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;did they think to
govern the world with their own weights and measures, <i>in
secula seculorum</i>?&nbsp; Methinks, the blinking and false
lights of their shops should have minded them of their quarter,
in the other world, aforehand.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis all a case,
with jewellers, goldsmiths, and other <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>trades, that serve only to flatter
and bolster up the world in luxury and folly.&nbsp; But if people
would be wise, these youths should have little enough to
do.&nbsp; For what&rsquo;s their cloth of gold and silver, their
silks, their diamond and pearl, (which they sell at their own
price) but matter of mere wantonness and superfluity?&nbsp; These
are they that inveigle ye into all sorts of extravagant expenses,
and so ruin ye insensibly, under colour of kindness and
credit.&nbsp; For they set everything at double the rate; and if
you keep not touch at your day, your persons are imprisoned, your
goods seized, and your estates extended.&nbsp; And they that
helped to make you princes before, are now the forwardest to put
you into the condition of beggars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The devil would have talked on, if I had given him the
hearing, but there was such a laugh set up on one side of me, as
if they would all have split; and I went to see what the matter
was; for &rsquo;twas a strange thing, methought, to hear them so
merry in hell.&nbsp; The business was, there were two men upon a
scaffold, in Gentile habits, gaping as loud as they could
bawl.&nbsp; One of them had a great parchment in his hand,
displayed, with divers&rsquo; labels hanging <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>at it, and
several seals.&nbsp; I thought at first it might have been
execution-day, and took the writing for a pardon or
reprieve.&nbsp; At every word they spoke, a matter of seven or
eight thousand devils burst out a-laughing, as they would have
cracked their sides.&nbsp; And this again made me think, it might
be some jack-pudding or mountebank, showing his tricks or his
attestations, with his congregation of fools about him.&nbsp;
But, nearer hand, I found my mistake; and that the devils&rsquo;
mirth made the gentlemen angry.&nbsp; At last, I perceived that
this great earnestness of theirs was only to make out their
pedigree, and get themselves passed for gentlemen; the parchment
being a testimonial from the Heralds Office to that
purpose.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; says he with the writing
in&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;bore arms for His Majesty in many
honourable occasions of watching and warding; and has made many a
tall fellow speak to the constable, at all hours of the
night.&nbsp; My uncle was the first man that ever was of the
Order of the Black-Guard: and we have had five brave commanders
of our family, by my father&rsquo;s side, that have served the
State in the quality of marshal&rsquo;s men and turnkeys, and
given His Majesty a fair account of all the <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>prisoners
committed to their charge.&nbsp; And by my mother&rsquo;s side,
it will not be denied but that I am honourably descended; for my
grandmother was never without a dozen chamber-maids and nurses in
family.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It may be &rsquo;twas her
trade,&rdquo; quoth the devil, &ldquo;to procure services and
servants, and consequently to deal in that
commodity.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the
cavalier, &ldquo;she was what she was; and I&rsquo;m sure I tell
you nothing but truth.&nbsp; Her husband wore a sword, by his
place, for he was a Deputy-Marshal; and to prove myself a man of
honour, I have it here in black and white, under the Seal of the
Office.&nbsp; Why must I then be quartered among a pack of
rascals?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My gentleman friend,&rdquo; quoth
the devil, &ldquo;your grandfather wore a sword, as he was usher
to a fencing school; and we know very well what his son and
grandchild can pretend to.&nbsp; But let that pass; you have led
a wicked and infamous life, and spent your time in whoring,
drinking, blaspheming, and in lewd company; and do you tell us
now of the privileges of your nobility?&nbsp; Your testimonials;
and the Seal of the Office?&nbsp; A fart for your privileges,
testimonials, office and all.&nbsp; There is no honour, but
virtue.&nbsp; And if <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>your children, though they had a
scoundrel to their father, should come to do honourable and
worthy things, we should look upon them as persons sacred, and
not dare to meddle with them.&nbsp; But talking is time lost; you
were ever a couple of pitiful fellows, and your tails scarce
worth the scalding.&nbsp; Have at ye,&rdquo; says he, and at that
word, with a huge iron bar he gave him such a salute over the
buttocks, that he took two or three turns in the air, heels over
head, and dropped at last into the common-shore; where never any
man as yet found the bottom.</p>
<p>When his companion had seen him cut that caper, &ldquo;This
usage,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;may be well enough for a parchment
gentleman; but for a cavalier of my extraction, and profession, I
suppose you&rsquo;ll treat him with somewhat more of civility and
respect.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cavalier,&rdquo; quoth the devil,
&ldquo;if you have brought no better plea along with you than the
antiquity of your house, you may e&rsquo;en follow your comrade,
for ought I know, for we find very few ancient families that had
not some oppressor or usurper for their founders; and they are
commonly continued by the same means they were begun.&nbsp; How
many are there of our titular nobility, that write Noble purely
upon the <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>account of their violence and injustice?&nbsp; Their
subjects and tenants, what with impositions, hard services, and
racked rents, are they not worse than slaves?&nbsp; If they
happen to have anything extraordinary, as a pleasant fruit, a
handsome colt, a good cow; and that the landlord, or his sweet
lady take a liking to it, they must either submit to part with it
gratis, or else take their pay in foul language or
bastinadoes.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis well if they &rsquo;scape so:
for many times when the sign&rsquo;s in Gemini, their wives and
daughters go to pot, without any regard of laws either sacred or
profane.&nbsp; What damned blasphemies and imprecations do they
make use of, to get credit with a mistress or a creditor, upon a
faithless promise!&nbsp; How intolerable is their pride and
insolence, even towards many considerable officers, both in
Church and State! for they behave themselves as if all people
below their quality and rank in the world were but as so many
brutes, or worse.&nbsp; As if human blood were not all of a
colour; as if nature had not brought them into the world the
common way, or moulded them of the same materials with the
meanest wretches upon the earth.&nbsp; And then, for such as have
military charges and commands, how many great officers are <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>there, that
without any consideration of their own, or their princes&rsquo;
honour, fall to spoil and pillage?&nbsp; Cozening the State with
false musters, and the soldiers of their pay; and giving them,
instead of their due from the prince, a liberty of taking what is
not their due from the people; forcing them to take the bread out
of the poor labourers&rsquo; mouths to fill their own bellies,
and protecting them when they have done in the most execrable
outrages imaginable.&nbsp; And when the poor soldier comes at
last to be dismissed, or disbanded; lame, sick, beggarly, naked
almost, and enraged; with nothing left him to trust to but the
highway to keep him from starving.&nbsp; What mischief is there
in the world, that these men are not the cause of?&nbsp; How many
good families are utterly ruined, and at this day in the
hospital, for trusting to their oaths and promises! and becoming
bound for them, for vast sums of money to maintain them in
tipple, and whores, and in all sorts of luxury and
riot?&rdquo;&nbsp; This rhetorical devil would have said a
thousand times more, but that his companions called him off, and
told him they had business elsewhere.&nbsp; The cavalier hearing
that, &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your morals are
very good, but <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>yet with your favour, all men are not
alike.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a barrel better
herring,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;you are all of ye tainted
with original sin, and if you had been any better than your
fellows you had never been sent hither.&nbsp; But if you are
indeed so noble, as you say, you&rsquo;re worth the burning, if
&rsquo;twere but for your ashes.&nbsp; And that you may have no
cause of complaint, you shall see, we&rsquo;ll treat you like a
person of your condition.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in that instant, two
devils presented themselves; the one of them bridled and saddled;
and the other, doing the office of the squire; holding the
stirrup, with his left hand, and giving the gentleman a lift into
the saddle with the other.&nbsp; Which was no sooner done, but
away he went like an arrow out of a bow.&nbsp; I asked the devil
then into what country he carried him.&nbsp; And he told me, not
far: for &rsquo;twas only matter of decorum, to send the nobility
to hell a-horseback.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look on that side now,&rdquo;
says he, and so I did; and there I saw the poor cavalier in a
huge furnace, with the first inventors of nobility, and arms: as
Cain, Cham, Nimrod, Esau, Romulus, Tarquin, Nero, Caligula,
Domitian, Heliogabalus; and a world of other brave fellows, that
had made <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>themselves famous by usurpation and blood.&nbsp; The
place was a little too hot for me, and so I retired, meditating
on what I had heard; and not a little satisfied with the
discourse of so learned a devil.&nbsp; Till that time I took the
devil for a notorious liar; but I find now that he can speak the
truth too, when he pleases; and I would not for all I am worth
but have heard him preach.</p>
<p>When I was thus far, my curiosity carried me still farther;
and within twenty yards I came to a huge muddy, stinking lake,
near twice as big as that of Geneva; and heard in&rsquo;t so
strange a noise that I was almost out of my wits to know what it
was.&nbsp; They told me that the lake was stored with
Do&uuml;egnas, or Gouvernantes, which are turned into a kind of
frogs in hell, and perpetually drivelling, sputtering, and
croaking.&nbsp; Methought the conversion was apt enough; for they
are neither fish, nor flesh, no more than frogs; and only the
lower parts of them are man&rsquo;s-meat, but their heads are
enough to turn a very good stomach.&nbsp; I could not but laugh
to see how they gaped, and stretched out their legs as they swam,
and still as we came near they&rsquo;d scud away and dive.</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>This
was no place to stay in, there was so noisome a vapour; and so I
struck off, upon the left hand, where I saw a number of old men
beating their breasts and tearing their faces, with bitter groans
and lamentations.&nbsp; It made my heart ache to see them, and I
asked what they were: answer was made, that I was now in the
quarter of the fathers that damned themselves to raise their
posterity; which were called by some, the unadvised.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wretch that I am!&rdquo; cried one of them, &ldquo;the
greatest penitent that ever lived, never suffered the
mortification I have endured.&nbsp; I have watched, I have
fasted, I have scarce had any clothes to my back; my whole life
has been a restless course of torment, both of body and mind: and
all this, to get money for my children; that I might see them
well married; buy them places at court, or procure them some
other preferment in the world: starving myself in the conclusion,
rather than I would lessen the provision I had made for my
posterity.&nbsp; And yet, notwithstanding this my fatherly care,
I was scarce sooner dead, than forgotten: and my next heir buried
me without tears, or mourning; and indeed without so much as
paying of legacies, or praying for my soul: as if they <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>had already
received certain intelligence of my damnation.&nbsp; And to
aggravate my sorrows, the prodigals are now squandering and
consuming that estate, in gaming, whoring, and debauches, which I
had scraped together by so much industry, vexation and
oppression, and for which I suffer at this instant such
insupportable torments.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This should have been
thought on before,&rdquo; cried a devil, &ldquo;for sure you have
heard of the old saying, &lsquo;Happy is the child whose father
goes to the devil.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; At which word, the old
misers brake out into fresh rage and lamentation, tearing their
flesh, with tooth and nail, in so rueful a manner, that I was no
longer able to endure the spectacle.</p>
<p>A little farther there was a dark, hideous prison, where I
heard the clattering of chains, the crackling of flames, the
slapping of whips, and a confused outcry of complaints.&nbsp; I
asked what quarter this was; and they told me it was the quarter
of the Oh that I had&rsquo;s!&nbsp; &ldquo;What are those,&rdquo;
said I?&nbsp; Answer was made, that they were a company of
brutish sots, so absolutely delivered up to vice, that they were
damned insensibly, and in hell before they were aware.&nbsp; They
are now reflecting upon their miscarriages and <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>omissions,
and perpetually crying out, &ldquo;Oh that I had examined my
conscience!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that I had frequented the
Sacraments!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that I had humbled myself with
fasting, and prayer!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that I had served God
as I ought!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that I had visited the sick,
and relieved the poor!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that I had set a
watch before the door of my lips!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left these late repentants, (as it appeared) in exchange for
worse, which were shut up in a base court, and the nastiest that
ever I saw.&nbsp; These were such as had ever in their mouths,
&ldquo;God is merciful, and will pardon me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can this be,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that these people
should be damned? when condemnation is an act of justice, not of
mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I perceive you are simple,&rdquo;
quoth the devil, &ldquo;for half these you see here, are
condemned with the mercy of God in their mouths.&nbsp; And to
explain myself, consider I pray&rsquo;e how many sinners are
there, that go on in their ways, in spite of reproof, and good
counsel; and still this is their answer, &lsquo;God is merciful,
and will not damn a soul for so small a matter.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
let them talk of mercy as they please, so long as they persist in
a wicked life, we are like to have their company at
last.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By your argument,&rdquo; said <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>I,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no trusting to Divine Mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mistake me,&rdquo; quoth the devil, &ldquo;for every
good thought and work flows from that mercy.&nbsp; But this I
say: He that perseveres in his wickedness, and makes use of the
name of mercy, only for a countenance to his impieties, does but
mock the Almighty, and has no title to that mercy.&nbsp; For
&rsquo;tis vain to expect mercy from above, without doing
anything in order to it.&nbsp; It properly belongs to the
righteous and the penitent; and they that have the most of it
upon the tongue have commonly the least thought of it in their
hearts: and &rsquo;tis a great aggravation of guilt, to sin the
more, in confidence of an abounding mercy.&nbsp; It is true that
many are received to mercy, that are utterly unworthy of it,
which is no wonder, since no man of himself can deserve it: but
men are so negligent of seeking it betimes, that they put that
off to the last, which should have been the first part of their
business; and many times their life is at end, before they begin
their repentance.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not think so damned a doctor
could have made so good a sermon.&nbsp; And there I left him.</p>
<p>I came next to a noisome dark hole, and there I saw a company
of dyers, all in dirt and smoke, intermixed with the devils, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>and so
alike that it would have posed the subtlest inquisitor in Spain
to have said, which were the devils and which the dyers.</p>
<p>There stood at my elbow a strange kind of mongrel devil, begot
betwixt a black and a white; with a head so bestruck with little
horns, that it looked at a distance like a hedgehog.&nbsp; I took
the boldness to ask him, where they quartered the Sodomites, the
old women and the cuckolds.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for the
cuckolds,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they are all over hell, without
any certain quarter or station; and in truth, &rsquo;tis no easy
matter to know a cuckold from a devil, for (like kind husbands)
they wear their wives&rsquo; favours still, and the very same
headpieces in hell that they wore living in the world.&nbsp; As
to the Sodomites, we have no more to do with them than needs
must; but upon all occasions, we either fly, or face them: for if
ever we come to give them a broadside, &rsquo;tis ten to one but
we get a hit betwixt wind and water; and yet we fence with our
tails, as well as we can, and they get now and then a flap
o&rsquo;er the mouth into the bargain.&nbsp; And for the old
women, we make them stand off; for we take as little pleasure in
them, as you do: and yet the jades will be persecuting us with
their passions; and ye shall have a bawd of five-and-fifty <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>do ye all
the gambols of a girl of fifteen.&nbsp; And yet, after all this,
there&rsquo;s not an old woman in hell; for let her be as old as
Paul&rsquo;s &mdash; bald, blind, toothless, wrinkled, decrepit:
this is not long of her age, she&rsquo;ll tell you; but a
terrible fit of sickness last year, that fetched off her hair,
and brought her so low that she has not yet recovered her flesh
again.&nbsp; She lost her eyes by a hot rheum; and utterly
spoiled her teeth with cracking of peach-stones and eating of
sweet-meats when she was a maid.&nbsp; And when the weight of her
years has almost brought both ends together, &rsquo;tis nothing
she&rsquo;ll tell ye but a crick she has got in her back: and
though she might recover her youth again, by confessing her age,
she&rsquo;ll never acknowledge it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My next encounter was, a number of people making their moan
that they had been taken away by sudden death.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an impudent lie,&rdquo; cried a devil,
&ldquo;(saving this gentleman&rsquo;s presence) for no man dies
suddenly.&nbsp; Death surprises no man, but gives all men
sufficient warning and notice.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was much taken with
the devil&rsquo;s civility and discourse; which he pursued after
this manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do ye complain,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;of sudden death? that have carried death about ye, ever
since you <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>were born; that have been entertained with daily
spectacles of carcasses and funerals; that have heard so many
sermons upon the subject; and read so many good books upon the
frailty of life and the certainty of death.&nbsp; Do ye not know
that every moment ye live brings ye nearer to your end?&nbsp;
Your clothes wear out, your woods and your houses decay, and yet
ye look that your bodies should be immortal.&nbsp; What are the
common accidents and diseases of life, but so many warnings to
provide yourself for a remove?&nbsp; Ye have death at the table,
in your daily food and nourishment; for your life is maintained
by the death of other creatures.&nbsp; And you have the lively
picture of it, every night for your bedfellow.&nbsp; With what
face then can you charge your misfortunes upon sudden death? that
have spent your whole life, both at bed, and at board, among so
many remembrances of your mortality.&nbsp; No, no; change your
style, and hereafter confess yourselves to have been careless and
incredulous.&nbsp; You die, thinking you are not to die yet; and
forgetting that death grows upon you, and goes along with ye from
one end of your life to the other, without distinguishing of
persons or ages, sex or quality; and whether it finds ye <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>well or
ill-doing; As the tree falls, so it lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning toward my left hand, I saw a great many souls that
were put up in gallipots, with <i>Assa f&oelig;tida</i>,
<i>Galbanum</i>, and a company of nasty oils that served them for
syrup.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a damned stink is here,&rdquo; cried I,
stopping my nose.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are now come undoubtedly to the
devil&rsquo;s house of office.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;
said their tormentor, (which was a kind of a yellowish
complexioned devil) &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a confection of
apothecaries.&nbsp; A sort of people, that are commonly damned
for compounding the medicines by which their patients hoped to be
saved.&nbsp; To give them their due, these are your only true and
chemical philosophers; and worth a thousand of Raymund Lullius,
Hermes, Geber, Ruspicella, Avicen, and their fellows; &rsquo;tis
true, they have written fine things of the transmutation of
metals; but did they ever make any gold?&nbsp; Or if they did, we
have lost the secret.&nbsp; Whereas your apothecaries, out of a
little puddle-water, a bundle of rotten sticks, a box of
flies&mdash;nay out of toads, vipers, and a Sir Reverence itself,
will fetch ye gold ready minted, and fit for the market; which is
more than all your philosophical projectors ever pretended
to.&nbsp; There is no <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>herb so poisonous, (let it be
hemlock) nor any stone so dry, (suppose the pumice itself) but
they&rsquo;ll draw silver out of it.&nbsp; And then for words,
&rsquo;tis impossible to make up any word out of the
four-and-twenty letters, but they&rsquo;ll show ye a drug, or a
plant of the name; and turn the alphabet into as good money as
any&rsquo;s in your pocket.&nbsp; Ask them for an eye-tooth of a
flying toad; they&rsquo;ll tell ye, yes, ye may have of it, in
powder; or if you had rather have the infusion of a tench of the
mountains, in a little eel&rsquo;s milk, &rsquo;tis all one to
them.&nbsp; If there be but any money stirring, you shall have
what you will, though there be no such thing in nature.&nbsp; So
that it looks as if all the plants and stones of the creation had
their several powers and virtues given them, only for the
apothecaries&rsquo; sakes; and as if words themselves had been
only made for their advantage.&nbsp; Ye call them apothecaries,
but instead of that, I pray&rsquo;e call them armourers; and
their shops, arsenals; are not their medicines as certain death
as swords, daggers, or muskets? while their patients are purged
and blooded into the other world, without any regard either to
distemper, measure, or season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will now see the pleasantest sight you have seen
yet, walk up but these two <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>steps, and you shall see a jury (or
conspiracy) of barber-surgeons, sitting upon life and
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; You must think that any divertisement there
was welcome, so that I went up, and found it in truth a very
pleasant spectacle.&nbsp; These barbers were most of them chained
by the middle, their hands at liberty, and every one of them a
cittern about his neck, and upon his knees a chess-board; and
still as he reached to have a touch at the cittern, the
instrument vanished; and so did the chess-board, when he thought
to have a game at draughts; which is directly tantalising the
poor rogues, for a cittern is as natural to a barber as milk to a
calf.&nbsp; Some of them were washing of asses&rsquo; brains, and
putting them in again; and scouring of negroes to make them
white.</p>
<p>When I had laughed my fill at these fooleries, my next
discovery was, of a great many people, grumbling and muttering,
that there was nobody looked after them; no not so much as to
torment them; as if their tails were not as well worth the
toasting as their neighbours&rsquo;.&nbsp; Answer was made, that
being a kind of devils themselves, they might put in for some
sort of authority in the place, and execute the office of
tormentors.&nbsp; This made me ask what they <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>were.&nbsp;
And a devil told me (with respect) that they were a company of
ungracious, left-handed wretches, that could do nothing
aright.&nbsp; And their grievance was that they were quartered by
themselves; but not knowing whether they were men or no, or
indeed what else to make of them, we did not know how to match
them, or in what company to put them.&nbsp; In the world they are
looked upon as ill omens; and let any man meet one of them, upon
a journey in a morning, fasting, &rsquo;tis the same thing as if
a hare had crossed the way upon him; he presently turns head in a
discontent, and goes to bed again.&nbsp; Ye know that
Sc&aelig;vola, when he found his mistake, in killing another for
Porsenna (the secretary, for the prince) burned his right hand in
revenge of the miscarriage; now the severity of the vengeance,
was not so much the maiming or the crippling of himself, but the
condemning of himself to be for ever left-handed.&nbsp; And so
&rsquo;tis with a malefactor that suffers justice; the shame and
punishment does not lie so much in the loss of his right hand, as
that the other is left.&nbsp; And it was the curse of an old
bawd, to a fellow that had vexed her, that he might go to the
devil by the stroke of a left-handed man.&nbsp; If the poets
speak truth, (as &rsquo;twere a wonder <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>if they
should not) the left is the unlucky side; and there never came
any good from it.&nbsp; And for my last argument against these
creatures; the goats and reprobates stand upon the left hand, and
left-handed men are, in effect, a sort of creature that&rsquo;s
made to do mischief; nay whether I should call them men, or no, I
know not.</p>
<p>Hereupon, a devil beckoned me to come softly to him; and so I
did, without a word speaking or the least noise in the
world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll
see the daily exercise of ill-favoured women, look through that
lattice window.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there I saw such a kennel of
ugly bitches, you would have blest yourself.&nbsp; Some, with
their faces so pounced and speckled, as if they had been
scarified, and newly passed the cupping-glass; with a world of
little plaisters, long, round, square; and briefly, cut out into
such variety, that it would have posed a good mathematician to
have found out another figure; and you would have sworn that they
had been either at cat&rsquo;s play or cuffs.&nbsp; Others, were
scraping their faces with pieces of glass; tearing up their
eyebrows by the roots, like mad; and some that had none to tear
were fetching out of their black boxes, such as they could get,
or make.&nbsp; Others were <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>powdering and curling their false
locks, or fastening their new ivory teeth in the place of their
old ebony ones.&nbsp; Some were chewing lemon peel, or cinnamon,
to countenance a foul breath; and raising themselves upon their
ciopines, that their view might be the fairer and their fall the
deeper.&nbsp; Others were quarrelling with their looking-glasses,
for showing them such hags&rsquo; faces: and cursing the State of
Venice for entertaining no better workmen.&nbsp; Some were
stuffing out their bodies, like pack saddles, to cover secret
deformities: and some again had so many hoods over their faces,
to conceal the ruins, that I could hardly discern what they were;
and these passed for penitents.&nbsp; Others, with their pots of
hog&rsquo;s grease and pomatum were sleeking and polishing their
faces, and indeed their foreheads were bright and shining, though
there were neither suns nor stars in that firmament.&nbsp; Some
there were (in fine) that would have fetched a man&rsquo;s guts
up at&rsquo;s mouth, to see them with their masques of
after-births; and with their menstruous slibber slobbers, daubing
one another to take away the heats and bubos.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nasty
and abominable!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; quoth
the devil, &ldquo;you see now how far a woman&rsquo;s wit and
invention will carry her to her own destruction.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>I could not
speak one word for astonishment at so horrid a spectacle, till I
had a little recollected myself; and then said I, &ldquo;If I may
deal freely without offence, I dare defy all the devils in hell
to outdo these women.&nbsp; But pray&rsquo;e let&rsquo;s be gone,
for the sight of them makes my very heart ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn about then,&rdquo; said the devil, and there was a
fellow sitting in a chair, all alone; never a devil near him; no
fire or frost; no heat or cold, or anything else, that I could
perceive, to torment him; and yet crying and roaring out the most
hideously of anything I had yet heard in hell; tearing his flesh,
and beating his body, like a bedlam; and his heart, all the
while, bleeding at his eyes.&nbsp; Good Lord, thought I, what
ails this wretch, to yell out thus when nobody hurts him!&nbsp;
So I went up to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the meaning of all this fury and transport?
for, so far as I can see, there&rsquo;s nothing to trouble
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says he with a horrid
outcry, and with all the extravagances of a man in rage and
despair, &ldquo;you do not see my tormentors; but the
all-searching eye of the Almighty sees my pains as well as my
transgressions, and with a severe and implacable justice has
condemned me to <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>suffer punishments answerable to my
crimes.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Which words he uttered with redoubled
clamours.)&nbsp; &ldquo;My executioners are in my soul, and all
the plagues of hell in my conscience.&nbsp; My memory serves me
instead of a cruel devil.&nbsp; The remembrance of the good I
should have done, and omitted; and of the ill I should not have
done, and did.&nbsp; The remembrance of the wholesome counsels I
have rejected, and of the ill example I have given.&nbsp; And for
the aggravation of my misery; where my memory leaves afflicting
me, my understanding begins: showing me the glories and
beatitudes I have lost, which others enjoy, who have gained
heaven with less anxiety and pain than I have endured to compass
my damnation.&nbsp; Now am I perpetually meditating on the
comforts, beauties, felicities, and raptures of paradise, only to
enflame and exasperate my despair in hell; begging in vain but
for one moment&rsquo;s interval of ease, without obtaining any;
for my will is also as inexorable as either my memory or my
understanding.&nbsp; And these (my friend of the other world) are
the three faculties of my soul, which Divine Justice, for my
sins, has converted into three tormentors, that torture me
without noise; into three flames, that burn me <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>without
consuming.&nbsp; And if I chance at any time to have the least
remission or respite, the worm of my conscience gnaws my soul,
and finds it, to an insatiable hunger, an immortal aliment and
entertainment.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that word, turning towards me with
a hellish yell, &ldquo;Mortal,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;learn, and
be assured from me, that all those that either bury or misemploy
their talents, carry a hell within themselves, and are damned
even above ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he returned to his usual
clamours.&nbsp; Upon this, I left him, miserably sad and
pensive.&nbsp; Well, thought I, what a weight of sin lies upon
this creature&rsquo;s conscience!&nbsp; Whereupon the devil
observing me in a muse, told me in my ear, that this fellow had
been an atheist, and believed neither God nor devil.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Deliver me then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;from that
unsanctified wisdom, that serves us only for our further
condemnation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was gone but a step or two aside, and I saw a world of
people running after burning chariots, with a great many souls in
them, and the devils tearing them with pincers; and before them
marched certain officers, making proclamation of their sentence,
which with much ado I got near enough to hear, and it was to this
effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Divine Justice hath appointed this
punishment <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>to the scandalous, for giving ill examples to their
neighbours.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at the same time, several of the
damned laid their sins to their charge, and cried out, that
&rsquo;twas &rsquo;long of them they were thus tormented.&nbsp;
So that the scandalous were punished both for their own sins and
for the offences of those they had misled to their
destruction.&nbsp; And these are they of whom &rsquo;tis said,
that they had better never have been born.</p>
<p>My very soul was full of anguish, to see so many doleful
spectacles; and yet I could not but smile, to see the vintners
everywhere up and down hell, as free as if they had been in their
taverns, and only prisoners upon parole.&nbsp; I asked how they
came by that privilege; and a devil told me, there was no need of
shackling them, or so much as shutting them up; for there was no
fear of their making a &rsquo;scape, that took so much pains in
the world, and made it their whole business to come
thither.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if we can keep
them from throwing water in the fire, as they do in their wines,
we are well enough.&nbsp; But if you would see somewhat worth the
while, leave these fellows, and follow me; and I&rsquo;ll show ye
Judas and his brethren, the stewards, and
purse-bearers.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I did <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>as he bade me, and he brought me to
Judas, and his companions, who had no faces, divers of them, and
most of them no foreheads.</p>
<p>I was well enough pleased to see him, and to be better
informed; for I had ever fancied him to be a kind of an
olive-coloured, tawny-complexioned fellow, without a beard; and
an Eunuch into the bargain: which perhaps (nay probably) he was;
for nothing but a capon, a thing unmanned, could ever have been
guilty of so sordid and treacherous a villainy, as to sell and
betray his Master, with a kiss; and after that, so cowardly, as
to hang himself in despair, when he had done.&nbsp; I do believe,
however, what the Church says of him, that he had a carrot beard
and a red head; but it may be his beard was burnt, and as he
appeared to me in hell I could not but take him for an Eunuch,
which to deal freely, is my opinion of all the devils, for they
have no hair; and they are for the most part wrinkled and
baker-legged.</p>
<p>Judas was beset with a great many money-mongers and
purse-bearers, that were telling him stories of the pranks they
had played, and the tricks they had put upon their masters, after
his example.&nbsp; <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>Coming up to them, I perceived that their punishment
was like that of Titius, who had a vulture continually gnawing
upon his liver; for there were a number of ravenous birds
perpetually preying upon them, and tearing off their flesh; which
grew again as fast as they devoured it; a devil in the meantime
crying out, and the damned filling the whole place with clamour
and horror; Judas, with his purse, and his pot by his side,
bearing a large part in the outcry and torment.&nbsp; I had a
huge mind (methought) to have a word or two with Judas, and so I
went to him with this greeting: &ldquo;Thou perfidious, impudent,
impious traitor,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to sell thy Lord and
Master at so base a price, like an avaricious
rascal.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;were
not ungrateful, they would rather pity, or commend me, for an
action so much to their advantage, and done in order to their
redemption.&nbsp; The misery is mine, that am to have no part
myself in the benefit I have procured to others.&nbsp; Some
heretics there are (I must confess to my comfort) that adore me
for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But do you take me for the only Judas?&nbsp;
No, no.&nbsp; There have been many since the death of my Master,
and there are at this day, more wicked and ungrateful, ten
thousand times <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>than myself; that buy the Lord of Life, as well as sell
Him, scourging and crucifying Him daily with more spite and
ignominy than the Jews.&nbsp; The truth is, I had an itch to be
fingering of money, and bartering, from my very entrance into the
apostleship.&nbsp; I began, you know, with the pot of ointment,
which I would fain have sold, under colour of a relief to the
poor.&nbsp; And I went on, to the selling of my Master, wherein I
did the world a greater good than I intended, to my own
irreparable ruin.&nbsp; My repentance now signifies
nothing.&nbsp; To conclude, I am the only steward that&rsquo;s
condemned for selling; all the rest are damned for buying: and I
must entreat you, to have a better opinion of me; for if
you&rsquo;ll look but a little lower here, you&rsquo;ll find
people a thousand times worse than myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Withdraw then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for I have had talk
enough with Judas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went down then some few steps, as Judas directed me; and
there I saw a world of devils upon the march, with rods and
stirrup-leathers in their hands, lashing a company of handsome
lasses, stark naked, and driving them out of hell, (which
methought was pity, and if I had had some of them in a corner, I
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>should
have treated them better) with the stirrup-leathers, they
disciplined a litter of bawds.&nbsp; I could not imagine why
these, of all others, should be expelled the place, and asked the
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says a devil, &ldquo;these are
our factresses in the world, and the best we have, so that we
send them back again to bring more grist to the mill: and indeed,
if it were not for women, hell would be but thinly peopled; for
what with the art, the beauty, and the allurements of the young
wenches, and the sage advice and counsel of the bawds, they do us
very good service.&nbsp; Nay, for fear any of our good friends
should tire upon the road, they send them to us on horseback, or
bring them themselves, e&rsquo;en to the very gates, lest they
should miss their way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pursuing my journey, I saw, a good way before me, a large
building, that looked (methought) like some enchanted castle, or
the picture of ill-luck; it was all ruinous, the chimneys down,
the planchers all to pieces, only the bars of the windows
standing; the doors all bedaubed with dirt, and patched up with
barrel-heads, where they had been broken.&nbsp; The glass gone,
and here and there a quarrel supplied with paper.&nbsp; I made no
doubt at first but the <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>house was forsaken; but, coming
nearer, I found it otherwise, by a horrible confusion of tongues
and noises within it.&nbsp; As I came just up to the door, one
opened it, and I saw in the house many devils, thieves, and
whores.&nbsp; One of the craftiest jades in the pack, placed
herself presently upon the threshold, and made her address to my
guide and me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;how
comes it to pass, I pray&rsquo;e, that people are damned both for
giving and taking?&nbsp; The thief is condemned for taking away
from another; and we are condemned for giving what is our
own.&nbsp; I do not find, truly, any injustice in our trade; and
if it be lawful to give every one their own, and out of their
own, why are we condemned?&rdquo;&nbsp; We found it a nice point,
and sent the wench to counsel learned in the law, for a
resolution in the case.&nbsp; Her mentioning of thieves made me
inquire after the scriveners and notaries.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
possible,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you should have none of them
here? for I do not remember that I have seen so much as one of
them upon the way; and yet I had occasion for a scrivener, and
made a search for one.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do believe
indeed,&rdquo; quoth the devil, &ldquo;that you have not found
any of them upon the road.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How then?&rdquo;
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>said I,
&ldquo;what, are they all saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
no,&rdquo; cried the devil, &ldquo;but you must understand, that
they do not foot it hither, as other mortals; but come upon the
wing, in troops like wild geese; so that &rsquo;tis no wonder you
see none of them upon the way.&nbsp; We have millions of them,
but they cut it away in a trice, for they are damnedly
rank-winged, and will make a flight, in the third part of a
minute, betwixt earth and hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But if there
be so many,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how comes it we see none of
them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For that,&rdquo; quoth the devil,
&ldquo;we change their names, when they come hither once, and
call them no longer notaries or scriveners, but cats: and they
are so good mousers, that though this place is large, old, and
ruinous, yet you see not so much as a rat or a mouse in hell, how
full soever of all other sorts of vermin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
ye talk of vermin,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are there any catchpoles
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, not one,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How so,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;when I dare undertake there
are five hundred rogues of the trade for one that&rsquo;s
ought.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The reason is,&rdquo; says the devil,
&ldquo;that every catchpole upon earth carries a hell in&rsquo;s
bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have still,&rdquo; said I,
crossing myself, &ldquo;an aching tooth at those poor
varlets.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; cried <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>he,
&ldquo;for they are but devils incarnate, and so damnedly versed
in the art of tormenting, that we live in continual dread of
losing our places, and that His Infernal Majesty should take
these rascals into his service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had enough of this, and travelling on, I saw a little way
off a great enclosure, and a world of souls shut up in&rsquo;t;
some of them weeping and lamenting without measure, others in a
profound silence.&nbsp; And this I understood to be the
lovers&rsquo; quarter.&nbsp; It saddened me to consider, that
death itself could not kill the lamentations of lovers.&nbsp;
Some of them were discoursing their passions, and teasing
themselves with fears and jealousies; casting all their miseries
upon their appetites and fancies, that still made the picture
infinitely fairer than the person.&nbsp; They were for the most
part troubled with a simple disease, called (as the devil told
me) &ldquo;I thought.&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked him what that was, and
he answered me, it was a punishment suitable to their offence:
for your lovers, when they fall short of their expectations,
either in the pursuit or enjoyment of their mistresses, they are
wont to say, &ldquo;Alas! I thought she would have loved me; I
thought she would never have pressed me to marry <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>her; I
thought she would have been a fortune to me; I thought she would
have given me all she had; I thought she would have cost me
nothing; I thought she would have asked me nothing; I thought she
would have been true to my bed; I thought she would have been
dutiful and modest; I thought she would never have kept her
gallant.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that all their pain and damnation comes
from I thought this or that, or so, or so.</p>
<p>In the middle of them was Cupid, a little beggarly rogue, and
as naked as he was born, only here and there covered with an odd
kind of embroidery: but whether it was the workmanship of the
itch, pox, or measles, I could not perfectly discover; and close
by him was this inscription&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Many a good fortune goes to wrack;<br />
And so does many an able back;<br />
With following whores and cards and dice,<br />
Were poxed and beggared in a trice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;by these rhymes methinks the
poets should not be far off;&rdquo; and the word was hardly out
of my mouth, when I discovered millions of them through a park
pale, and so I stopped to look upon them.&nbsp; (It seems in hell
they are not <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>called poets now, but fools.)&nbsp; One of them showed
me the women&rsquo;s quarter there hard by, and asked me what I
thought of it, and of the handsome ladies in it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
it not true,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that a buxom lass is a kind
of half chamber-maid to a man? when she has stripped him and
brought him to bed, she has done her business, and never troubles
herself any further about the helping him up again, and dressing
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Have ye
your quirks and conceipts in hell?&nbsp; In troth ye are
pleasant: I thought your edge had been taken off.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With that, out stepped the most miserable wretch of the whole
company laden with irons: &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;I
would to God the first inventor of rhymes and poetry were here in
my place,&rdquo; and then he went on with this following and sad
complaint.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">A
Complaint of the Poets in Hell</span></p>
<p>Oh, this damned trade of versifying<br />
Has brought us all to hell for lying!<br />
For writing what we do not think;<br />
Merely to make the verse cry clink.<br />
For rather than abuse the metre,<br />
Black shall be white, Paul shall be Peter.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>One
time I called a lady, whore;<br />
Which in my soul she was no more<br />
Than I am; a brave lass, no beggar,<br />
And true, as ever man laid leg o&rsquo;er.<br />
Not out of malice, Jove&rsquo;s my witness,<br />
But merely for the verses fitness.<br />
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re all made,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if luck
hold,&rdquo;<br />
And then I called a fellow cuckold;<br />
Though the wife was (or I&rsquo;ll be hanged)<br />
As good a wench as ever twanged.<br />
I was once plaguely put to&rsquo;t;<br />
This would not hit, that would not do&rsquo;t;<br />
At last, I circumcised (&rsquo;tis true)<br />
A Christian, and baptized a Jew.<br />
Nay I&rsquo;ve made Herod innocent<br />
For rhyming to Long-Parliament:<br />
Now to conclude, we are all damned ho,<br />
For nothing but a game at crambo.<br />
And for a little jingling pleasure,<br />
Condemned to torments without measure:<br />
Which is a little hard in my sense,<br />
To fry thus for poetic licence.<br />
&rsquo;Tis not for sin of thought or deed,<br />
But for bare sounds, and words we bleed:<br />
While the cur Cerberus lies growling<br />
In consort with our catterwowling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So soon as he had done.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is not in the
world,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;a more ridiculous <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>frenzy than
yours, to be poetising in hell.&nbsp; The humour sticks close
sure, or the fire would have fetched it out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried a devil, &ldquo;these versifiers are a
strange generation of buffoons.&nbsp; The time that others spend
in tears and groans for their sins and follies, these wretches
employ in songs and madrigals; and if they chance to light upon
the critical minute, and get a snap at a lady, all&rsquo;s worth
nothing, unless the whole kingdom ring of it, in some miserable
sing-song or other, under the name forsooth of Phyllis, Chloris,
Silvia, or the like: and the goodly idol must be decked and
dressed up with diamond, pearl, rubies, musk, and amber, and both
the Indies are too little to furnish eyes, lips, and teeth for
this imaginary goddess.&nbsp; And yet after all this magnificence
and bounty, it would put the poor devil&rsquo;s credit upon the
stretch, to take up an old petticoat in Long Lane, or a pair of
cast-shoes, at the next cobbler&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Beside, we can
give no account either of their country or religion.&nbsp; They
have Christian names, but most heretical souls; they are Arabians
in their hearts: and in their language, Gentiles; but to say the
truth, they fall short of the right Pagans in their
manners.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I stay here a little <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>longer,
(said I to myself) this spiteful devil will hit me over the
thumbs ere I&rsquo;m aware; for I was half jealous, that he took
me already for a piece of a poet.</p>
<p>For fear of being discovered, I went my way, and my next visit
was to the impertinent devotees, whose very prayers are made up
of impiety and extravagance.&nbsp; Oh! what sighing was there,
and sobbing! groaning and whining!&nbsp; Their tongues were tied
up to a perpetual silence; their souls drooping, and their ears
condemned to hear eternally the hideous cries and reproaches of a
wheezing devil, greeting them after this manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
ye impudent and profane abusers of prayer and holy duties! that
treat the Lord of heaven and earth in His own house, with less
respect than ye would do a merchant upon the Change, sneaking
into a corner with your execrable petitions, for fear of being
overheard by your neighbours; and yet without any scruple at all,
ye can expose and offer them up to that Eternal Purity! shameless
wretches that ye are!&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; says one,
&lsquo;take the old man, my father, to Thyself, I beseech Thee,
that I may have his office and estate.&nbsp; Oh, that this uncle
of mine would but march off!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a fat Bishopric,
and a good Deanery; I <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>would the devil had the incumbent so
I had the dignity.&nbsp; Now for a lusty pot of guineas, or a
lucky hand at dice if it be Thy pleasure, and then I would not
doubt of good matches for my children.&nbsp; Lord, make me His
Majesty&rsquo;s favourite and Thy servant; that I may get
what&rsquo;s convenient, and keep what I have gotten.&nbsp; Grant
me this, and I do here engage myself, to entertain six
blue-coats, and bind them out to good trades; to set up a lecture
for every day of the week; to give one-third part of my clear
gains to charitable uses; and another, toward the repairing of
Paul&rsquo;s; and to pay all honest debts, so far as may stand
with my private convenience.&rsquo;&nbsp; Blind and ridiculous
madness! for dust and ashes thus to reason and condition with the
Almighty! for beggars to talk of giving, and obtrude their vain
and unprofitable offerings upon the inexhaustible fountain of
riches and bounty!&nbsp; To pray for those things as blessings,
which are commonly showered down upon us for our confusion and
punishment.&nbsp; And when, in case your wishes take effect, what
becomes of all the sacred vows and promises ye made, in storms,
(perhaps) sickness or adversity? so soon as ye have gained your
port, recovered your health; <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>or patched up a broken fortune, you
show yourselves, all of ye, a pack of cheats; your vows and
promises are not worth so many rushes: they are forgotten with
your dreams; and to keep a promise upon devotion, that you made
out of necessity, is no article of your religion.&nbsp; Why do ye
not ask for peace of conscience?&nbsp; Increase of grace?&nbsp;
The aid of the Blessed Spirit?&nbsp; But you are too much taken
up with the things of this world, to attend those spiritual
advantages and treasures; and to consider, that the most
acceptable sacrifices and obligations you can make to the
Almighty, are purity of mind, an humble spirit, and a fervent
charity.&nbsp; The Almighty takes delight to be often called
upon, that He may often pour down His blessings upon His
petitioners.&nbsp; But such is the corruption of human nature,
that men seldom think of Him, unless under afflictions; and
therefore it is that they are often visited; for by adversity
they are brought to the knowledge and exercise of their
duty.&nbsp; I would now have you consider, how little reason
there is in your ordinary demands.&nbsp; Put case you have your
asking; what are you the better for the grant? since it fails you
at last; because you did not ask aright.&nbsp; <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>When you
die, your estate goes to your children; and for their parts, you
are scarce cold, before you are forgotten.&nbsp; You are not to
expect they should bestow much upon works of charity; for if
nothing went that way while you were living, they&rsquo;ll live
after your example when you are dead.&nbsp; And, beside,
there&rsquo;s no merit in the case.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this word
some of the poor creatures were about to reply; but the devils
had put barnacles upon their lips, that hindered them.</p>
<p>From thence, I went to the witches and wizards; such as
pretend to cure man and beast by charms, words, amulets,
characters: and these were all burning alive.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These,&rdquo; says a devil, &ldquo;are a company of
cozening rogues; the most accursed villains in nature.&nbsp; If
they help one man, they kill another, and only remove the disease
from a worse to a better: and yet there&rsquo;s no great clamour
against them neither; for if the patient recover, he&rsquo;s well
enough content, and the doctor gets both reputation and reward
for his pains.&nbsp; If he dies, his mouth is stopped, and forty
to one the next heir does him a good turn for the dispatch.&nbsp;
So that, hit or miss, all is well at last.&nbsp; If you enter
into a debate with them about their remedies, they&rsquo;ll tell
you, <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>they learned the mystery of a certain Jew; and
there&rsquo;s the original of the secret.&nbsp; Now to hear these
quacks give you the history of their cures, is beyond all the
plays and farces in the world.&nbsp; You shall have a fellow tell
you of fifteen people that were run clean through the body, and
glad for a matter of three days to carry their puddings in their
hands; that in four-and-twenty hours he made them as whole as
fishes, and not so much as a scar for a remembrance of the
orifice.&nbsp; Ask him, when and where? you&rsquo;ll find it some
twelve hundred leagues off, in a <i>terra incognita</i>, by the
token, that at that time he was physician in ordinary to a great
prince that died about five-and-twenty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; cried a devil, &ldquo;make an end of
this visit, and you shall see those now that Judas told you were
ten times worse than himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went along with him,
and he brought me to a passage into a great hall, where there was
a damned smell of brimstone, and a company of match-makers, as I
thought at first; but they proved afterward to be alchymists, and
the devils examining them upon interrogatories, who were filthily
put to&rsquo;t, to understand their gibberish.&nbsp; Their talk
was much of the planetary metals; gold they <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>called Sol;
silver, Luna; tin, Jupiter; copper, Venus.&nbsp; They had about
them their furnaces, crucibles, coal, bellows, clay, minerals,
dung, man&rsquo;s blood, powders, and alembics.&nbsp; Some were
calcining, others washing, here purifying, there
separating.&nbsp; Fixing what was volatile in one place, and
rarefying what was fix in another.&nbsp; Some were upon the work
of transmutation, and fixing of mercury with monstrous hammers
upon an anvil.&nbsp; And after they had resolved the vicious
matter, and sent out the subtler parts, that they came to the
coppel, all went away in fume.&nbsp; Some again were in a hot
dispute, what fuel was best; and whether Raymund Lullius his
fire, and no fire, could be anything else than lime; or otherwise
to be understood of the light effective of heat, and not of the
effective heat of fire.&nbsp; Others were making their entrance
upon the great work, after the hermetical method.&nbsp; Here they
were watching the progress of their operations, and making their
observations upon proportions and colour.&nbsp; While all the
rest of these blind oracles lay waiting for the recovery of the
<i>materia prima</i>, till they brought themselves to the last
cast both of their lives and fortunes, and instead of turning
base metals and <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>materials into gold, as they pretended, they made the
contrary inversion, and were glad at length to take up with
beggarly fools and false coiners.&nbsp; What a stir was there,
with crying out, ever and anon!&nbsp; &ldquo;Look ye, look ye!
the old father is got up again; down with him, down with
him;&rdquo; what glossing and commenting upon the old chymical
text, that says, &ldquo;Blessed be Heaven, that has ordered the
most excellent thing in nature out of the vilest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;If so,&rdquo; quoth one, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s try if we can
fetch the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone out of a common strumpet,
which is of all creatures undoubtedly the vilest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the word was no sooner out, but a matter of three-and-twenty
whores went to pot, but the flesh was so cursedly mawmish and
rotten, that they soon gave over the thought of that
projection.&nbsp; And then they entered upon a fresh
consultation, and concluded, <i>nemine contradicente</i>, that
the mathematicians, by that rule, were the only fit matter to
work upon; as being most damnably dry, (to say nothing of their
divisions among and against themselves) so that with one voice,
they called for a parcel of mathematicians, to the furnace, to
begin the experiment.&nbsp; But a devil came in just in the
God-speed, and told <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>them, &ldquo;Gentlemen
philosophers,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if you would know the
wretchedest and most contemptible thing in the world, it is an
alchymist: and we are of opinion, that you&rsquo;ll make as good
philosopher&rsquo;s stones as the mathematicians.&nbsp; However,
for curiosity&rsquo;s sake, we&rsquo;ll try for
once.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he threw them all together into a great
caldron; and to say the truth, the poor snakes suffered very
contentedly; out of a desire, I suppose, to help on toward the
perfecting of the operation.</p>
<p>On the other side were a knot of astrologers, and one among
the rest that had studied chiromancy or palmistry, who took all
the damned by the hands, one after another.&nbsp; One he told,
that it was as plain as the nose on his face, that he was to go
to the devil, for he perceived it by the Mount of Saturn.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You,&rdquo; says he to another, &ldquo;have been a
swindging whore-master in your days; I see that by the Mount of
Venus here, and by her girdle.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in short, every
man&rsquo;s destiny he read in his fist.&nbsp; After him advanced
another, creeping upon all four, with a pair of compasses betwixt
his teeth, his spheres and globes about him, his Jacob&rsquo;s
staff before him, and his eyes upon the stars, as if he were
taking a height or making <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>an observation.&nbsp; When he had
gazed a while, up he starts of a sudden, and, wringing his hands,
&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what an unlucky dog was
I!&nbsp; If I had come into the world but one half quarter of an
hour sooner, I had been saved; for just then Saturn shifted, and
Mars was lodged in the house of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; One that
followed him, bade his tormentors be sure he was dead;
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I am a little doubtful of it
myself; in regard that I had Jupiter for my ascendant, and Venus
in the house of life, and no malevolent aspect to cross me.&nbsp;
So that by the rules of astrology, I was to live, precisely, a
hundred years and one, two months, six days, four hours, and
three minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next that came up was a
geomancer; one that reduced all his skill to certain little
points, and by them would tell you, as well things past as to
come: these points he bestowed at a venture, among several
unequal lines; some long, others shorter, like the fingers of a
man&rsquo;s hand; and then, with a certain ribble-rabble of
mysterious words, he proceeds to his calculation, upon even or
odd, and challenges the whole world to allow him the most learned
and infallible of the trade.</p>
<p>There were divers great masters of the <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>science
that followed him.&nbsp; As Haly, Gerard, Bart&rsquo;lemew of
Parma, and one Toudin; a familiar friend, and companion of the
great Cornelius Agrippa, the famous conjurer, who though he had
but one soul was yet burning in four bodies.&nbsp; (I mean the
four damnable books he left behind him.)&nbsp; There was
Trithemius too, with his polygraphy and stenography; that had
devils now, his belly-full, though in his lifetime his complaint
was, that he could never have enough of their company; over
against him was Cardan; but they could not set their horses
together, because of an old quarrel, whether was the more
impudent of the two.&nbsp; And there I saw Misaldus, tearing his
beard, in rage, to find himself pumped dry; and that he could not
fool on, to the end of the chapter.&nbsp; Theophrastus was there
too, bewailing himself for the time he had spent at the
alchymist&rsquo;s bellows.&nbsp; There was also the unknown
author of <i>Clavicula Solomonis</i>, and <i>The Hundred Kings of
Spirits</i>, with the composer of the book, <i>Adversus Omnia
pericula Mundi</i>; Taysnerus too, with his book of
<i>Physiognomy</i> and <i>Chiromancy</i>; and he was doubly
punished, first for the fool he was, and then for those he had
made.&nbsp; Though, to give the man his due, <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>he knew
himself to be a cheat, and that he that gives a judgment upon the
lines of a face takes but a very uncertain aim.&nbsp; There were
magicians, necromancers, sorcerers, and enchanters innumerable,
beside divers private boxes that were kept for lords and ladies;
and other personages of great quality, that put their trust in
these disciples of the devil, and go to Strand Bridge or Billiter
Lane, for resolution in cases of death, love, or marriage, and
now and then to recover a gold watch or a pearl necklace.</p>
<p>Not far from these were a company of handsome women, that were
tormented in the quality of witches, which grieved my very heart
to see it; but to comfort me, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; says a devil,
&ldquo;have you so soon forgot the roguery of these
carrions?&nbsp; Have you not had trial enough yet of them? they
are the very poison of life, and the only dangerous magicians
that corrupt all our senses, and disturb the faculties of your
soul; these are they that cozen your eyes with false appearances,
and set up your wills in opposition to your understanding and
reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis right,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and now you mind me of it, I do very well remember, that I
have found them so; but let&rsquo;s go on and see the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>I was
scarce gone three steps farther, but I was got into so hideous a
dark place that it was e&rsquo;en a mercy we knew where we
were.&nbsp; There was first at the entrance, Divine Justice,
which was most dreadful to behold; and a little beyond stood
Vice, with a countenance of the highest pride and insolence
imaginable; there was Ingratitude, Malice, Ignorance, obstinate
and incorrigible Infidelity, brutish and headstrong Disobedience,
rash and imperious Blasphemy, with garments dipped in blood, eyes
sparkling, and a hundred pair of chops, barking at Providence,
and vomiting rage and poison.&nbsp; I went in (I confess) with
fear and trembling, and there I saw all the sects of idolaters
and heretics, that ever yet appeared upon the stage of the
universe; and at their feet, in a glorious array, was lascivious
Barbara, second wife to the Emperor Sigismund, and the queen of
harlots: one that agreed with Messalina in this, that virginity
was both a burden and a folly; and that in her whole life she was
never either wearied or satisfied; but herein she went beyond
her, in that she held the mortality as well of the soul as of the
body; but she was now better instructed, and burnt like a bundle
of matches.</p>
<p><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>Passing forward still, I spied a fellow in a corner,
all alone, with the flames about his ears, gnashing his teeth and
blaspheming through fury and despair.&nbsp; I asked him what he
was, and he told me he was Mahomet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;thou art the damnedest reprobate in
hell, and hast brought more wretches hither than half the world
beside: and Lucifer has done well to allot thee a quarter here by
thyself, for certainly thou hast well deserved the first place in
his dominions.&nbsp; But since every man chooses to talk of what
he loves, I prithee, good impostor, tell me, what&rsquo;s the
reason that thou hast forbidden wine to all thy
disciples?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I have
made them so drunk with my Alchoran they need no
tipple.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But why hast thou forbidden them
swines&rsquo; flesh too?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I would not affront the
jambon; for water upon gammon would be false heraldry.&nbsp; And
beside I never loved my people well enough to afford them the
pleasure, either of the grape or the spare-rib.&nbsp; Nay, and
for fear they should chance to grope out the way to heaven, I
have established my power and my dominion by force of arms;
without subjecting my laws to idle disputes and discourses of
reason.&nbsp; Indeed there is little of reason in my precepts, <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>and I would
have as little in their obedience.&nbsp; A world of disciples I
have, but I think they follow me more out of appetite than
religion, or for the miracles I work.&nbsp; I allow them liberty
of conscience; they have as many women as they please, and do
what they list, provided they meddle not with the
Government.&nbsp; But look about ye now, and you&rsquo;ll find
that there are more knaves than Mahomet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did so, and found myself presently surrounded with a ring of
heretics, and their adherents; many of which were ready to tear
out the throats of their leaders.&nbsp; One among the rest was
beset with a brace of devils, and either of them a pair of
bellows, puffing into each ear fire instead of air, which made
him a little hot-headed.&nbsp; There was another, that, as I was
told, was a kind of a symoniac, and had taken up his seat in a
pestilential chair; but it was so dark I could not well discern
whether it was a Pope or a Presbyter.</p>
<p>By this time I had enough of hell, and began to wish myself
out again; but as I was looking about for a retreat, I stumbled
upon a long gallery before I was aware: and there I saw Lucifer
himself, with all his nobility about him, male and female.&nbsp;
(For let married men say their pleasure, <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>there are
she-devils too,) I should have been at a damned loss what to do,
or how to behave myself among so many strange faces, if one of
the ushers had not come to me, and told me, that, being a
stranger, it was His Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure I should enter and
have free liberty of seeing what was there to be seen.&nbsp; We
exchanged a couple or two of compliments, and then I began to
look about me, but never did I see a palace so furnished, nor
indeed comparable to it.</p>
<p>Our furniture at the best is but a choice collection of dead
and dumb statues, or paintings, without life, sense, or motion;
but there, all the pieces were animated, and no trash in the
whole inventory; there was hardly anything to be seen, but
emperors and princes, with some few (perhaps) of their choicest
nobility and privados.&nbsp; The first bank was taken up by the
Ottoman family; and after them sat the Roman emperors, in their
order; and the Roman kings down to Tarquin the proud; beside
highnesses and graces, lords spiritual and temporal
innumerable.&nbsp; My lungs began now to call for a little fresh
air, and I desired my guide to show me the way out again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, yes, with all my heart,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;follow
me then:&rdquo; and so he <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>carried me away by a back passage
into Lucifer&rsquo;s house of office, where there was I know not
how many ton of Sir Reverence, and bales of flattering
panegyrics, not to be numbered; all of them licensed, and entered
according to order.&nbsp; I could not but smile at this provision
of tail-timber, and my guide took notice of it, who was a good
kind of a damned droll.&nbsp; But I called still to be gone, and
at length he led me to a little hole like the vent of a vault,
and I crept through it as nimbly as if the devil himself had
given me a lift at the crupper; when, to my great wonder, I found
myself in the park again, where I begun my story: not without an
odd medley of passions, partly reflecting upon what others
endured, and in part upon my own condition of ease and happiness,
that had deserved, perhaps, the contrary as well as they.&nbsp;
This thought put me upon a resolution of leading such a course of
life, for the future, that I might not come to feel these
torments in reality which I had now only seen in vision.</p>
<p>And I must here entreat the reader to follow my example,
without making any further experiment; and likewise not to cast
an ill construction upon a fair meaning.&nbsp; My design is to
discredit and discountenance the works of darkness, <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>without
scandalising of persons; and since I speak only of damned,
I&rsquo;m sure no honest man alive will reckon this discourse a
satire.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">THE END OF THE SIXTH VISION</p>
<h2><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>THE
SEVENTH VISION OF HELL REFORMED</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> happened lately so terrible
an uproar, and disorder in hell, that (though it be a place of
perpetual outrage and confusion) the oldest devil there never
knew the fellow of it; and the inhabitants expected nothing less
than an absolute topsy-turvy and dissolution of their
empire.&nbsp; The devils fell upon the damned; and the damned
fell upon the devils, without knowing one from t&rsquo;other: and
all running helter-skelter, to and again, like mad; for, in fine,
it was no other than a general revolt.&nbsp; This hurly-burly
lasted a good while, before any mortal could imagine the meaning
of it; but at length there came certain intelligence of a
monstrous talker, a pragmatical, meddling undertaker, and an old
bawd of a gouvernante, that had knocked off their shackles, and
made all this havoc: which may give the reader to understand what
kind of <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>cattle these are, that could make hell itself more
dangerous and unquiet.</p>
<p>Lucifer, in the meantime, went yelping up and down, and
bawling for chains, handcuffs, bolts, manacles, shackles,
fetters, to tie up his prisoners again; when, in the middle of
his career, he and the babbler or talker I told ye of met
full-butt; and after a little staring one another in the face,
upon the encounter, the babbler opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prince
mine,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you have a pack of lazy, droning
devils in your dominions, that look after nothing but sit with
their arms and legs across, and leave all your affairs at six and
seven.&nbsp; And you have divers abroad too, upon commission,
that have stayed out their time, and yet give you no account of
their employment.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gouvernante, who had been
blowing the coal and whispering sedition from one to another,
chanced to pass by in the interim, and, stopping short, addressed
herself to Lucifer: &ldquo;Look to yourself,&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;there is a desperate plot upon your diabolical crown and
dignity.&nbsp; There are two tyrants in&rsquo;t, three parasites,
a world of physicians, and whole legions of lawyers and
attorneys.&nbsp; One word more in your ear.&nbsp; There is among
them a <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>mongrel priest (a kind of a lay-elder) that will go
near to sit upon your skirts, if you have not a care of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the very name of priest and lay-elder Lucifer looked as
pale as death, stood stone-still, as mute as a fish, and in his
very looks discovered his apprehensions.&nbsp; After a little
pause he roused himself as out of a trance: &ldquo;A priest do ye
say? a lay-elder? tyrants? lawyers? physicians?&nbsp; A
composition to poison all the devils in hell, and purge their
very guts out.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that, away he went to visit the
avenues and set his guards, and who should he met next but the
meddler, in a monstrous haste and hurry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay
then,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;here is the forerunner of
ill-luck.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The matter?&rdquo; cried the meddler; and then with a huge
deal of tedious and impertinent circumstance, he up and told him
that a great many of the damned had contrived an escape; and that
there was a design to call in four or five regiments of
hypocrites and usurers, under colour forsooth of establishing a
better intelligence betwixt earth and hell, with a hundred other
fopperies; and had gone on till this time, if Lucifer would have
found ears.&nbsp; But he had other fish to fry; for neck <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>and all was
now at stake; and so he went about his business of putting all in
a posture, and strengthening his guards.&nbsp; And for the
further security of his royal person, he entertained into his own
immediate regiment several reformadoes of the society, that he
particularly knew to be no flinchers.</p>
<p>He began his survey in the vault and dungeons, among his
jailers and prisoners.&nbsp; The make-bate babbler marched in the
van, breathing an air that kindled and inflamed wherever he
passed, without giving any light (setting people together by the
ears, they know not why).&nbsp; In the second place the
gouvernante, as full of news and tittle-tattle as she could hold,
and telling her tale all the way she went.&nbsp; In the breech of
her followed the meddler, leering as he passed along, first on
one side then on the other, without ever moving his head, and
making fair with every soul he saw in&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; He gave
one a bow, t&rsquo;other a kiss; &ldquo;Your most humble
servant,&rdquo; to a third; &ldquo;Can I serve you, sir,&rdquo;
to a fourth: but every compliment was worse to the poor creatures
than the fire itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, traitor!&rdquo; says one;
&ldquo;for pity&rsquo;s sake away with this new tormentor!&rdquo;
cries another.&nbsp; &ldquo;This fellow <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>is hell
upon hell,&rdquo; says a third.&nbsp; As he trudged on there was
a rabble of rascals got together; and in the middle of the crowd
a most eminent knight of the post, a (great master of his trade)
that was reading a lecture to that venerable assembly, of the
noble mystery of swearing and lying; and would have taught any
man in one quarter of an hour to prove anything upon oath, that
he never saw nor heard of in his life.&nbsp; This doctor had no
sooner cast his eye upon the inter-meddler, but up he started in
a fright.&nbsp; &ldquo;How now,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is that
devil here?&nbsp; I came hither on purpose to avoid him; and if I
could but have dreamt he&rsquo;d have been in hell, beyond all
dispute I&rsquo;d have gone myself to paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was speaking we heard a great and a confused noise of
arms, blows, and outcries; and presently we discovered several
persons falling one upon another like lightning; and in short
with such a fury, that &rsquo;tis not for any tongue or pen to
describe the battle.&nbsp; One of them appeared to be an emperor;
for he was crowned with laurel, and surrounded with a grave sort
of people, that looked like counsellors or senators; and had all
the old statutes and records at their finger&rsquo;s end: by
which <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>they endeavoured to make it out, that a king might be
killed in his personal capacity, and his politic capacity never
the worse for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And upon this point were they at
daggers drawn with the emperor.&nbsp; Lucifer came then roundly
up to him, and with a voice that made hell quake, &ldquo;What are
you, sir,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that take upon you thus in my
dominions?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the great Julius
C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;that in this general tumult
thought to have revenged myself upon Brutus and Cassius, for
murdering me in the Senate, under colour (forsooth) of asserting
the common liberty: whereas these traitors did it merely out of
envy, avarice, and ambition.&nbsp; It was the emperor, not the
empire they hated.&nbsp; They pretended to destroy me, for
introducing a monarchy; but did they overthrow the monarchy
itself?&nbsp; No; but on the contrary, they confirmed it; and did
more mischief, in taking away my life than I did in dissolving
their republic.&nbsp; However, I died an emperor, and these
villains carried only the infamy and brand of regicides to their
graves, and the world has ever since adored my memory and
abhorred theirs.&nbsp; Tell me,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;ye cursed
bloodhounds,&rdquo; (turning <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>toward them) &ldquo;whether was your
government better, think ye, in the hands of your senators, a
company of talking gown-men, that knew not how to keep it, or in
the hands of a soldier that won it by his merit?&nbsp; It is not
the drawing of a charge, or making of a fine oration, that fits
people for government; nor will a crown sit well upon the head of
a pedant; but let him wear it that deserves it.&nbsp; He is the
true patriot that advances the glory of his country, by actions
of bravery and honour.&nbsp; Which has more right to rule, think
ye, he that only knows the laws, or he that maintains them?&nbsp;
The one only studies the government; the other protects it.&nbsp;
Wretched republic!&nbsp; Thou call&rsquo;st it freedom to obey a
divided multitude, and slavery to serve a single person; and when
a company of covetous little fellows are got together, they must
be styled fathers of their country, forsooth; and shall one
generous person take up with the name of tyrant?&nbsp; Oh! how
much better had it been for Rome to have preserved that one son
that made her mistress of the world, than that multitude of
fathers, who by so many intestine wars rendered her but a
stepmother to her own children.&nbsp; Barbarous and cruel that
you <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>are!
so much as to mention the name of a commonwealth, considering
that since the people tasted of monarchy they have preferred even
the worst of princes (as Nero, Tiberius, Caligula, Heliogabalus,
etc.) before your tribe of senators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This discourse of C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s struck Brutus with
exceeding shame and confusion; but at length, with a feeble and
trembling voice, he delivered himself to this effect.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gentlemen of the Senate,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;do ye not
hear C&aelig;sar? or will ye add sin to sin, and suffer all the
blame to be cast upon the instruments, when you yourselves were
the contrivers of the villainy?&nbsp; Why do ye not answer? for
C&aelig;sar speaks to you, as well as to us.&nbsp; Cassius and
myself were but your bravoes, and governed by your persuasions
and advice, little dreaming of that insatiable ambition that lay
lurking under the gravity of your long beards and robes.&nbsp;
But &rsquo;tis the practice of you all, to arraign that tyranny
in the prince, which you would exercise yourselves: in effect,
when you have gotten power, and the colour of authority in your
hands, it is more dangerous for a prince not to comply with you
than for a vassal to rebel against his prince.&nbsp; To what end
served your perfidious and ungrateful <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>treason?&nbsp; Make answer to
C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; But for our parts, in the conscience of our
sin, we feel the severity of our punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words a hollow-eyed, supercilious senator (that had
been of the conspiracy, and was then blazing like a pitched
barrel) raised himself, and with a faint voice asked C&aelig;sar
what reason he had to complain!&nbsp; &ldquo;For, prince,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;if King Ptolomy murdered Pompey the Great, upon
whose score he held his kingdom, why might not the Senate as well
kill you, to recover what you had taken from them?&nbsp; And in
the case betwixt C&aelig;sar and Pompey, let the devils
themselves be judges.&nbsp; As for Achilles (who was one of the
murderers) what he did, was by Ptolomy&rsquo;s command, and then
he was but a free-booter neither, a fellow that got his living by
rapine and spoil: but C&aelig;sar was undoubtedly the more
infamous of the two.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, you wept at the sight
of Pompey&rsquo;s head, but such tears as were more treacherous
than the steel that killed him.&nbsp; Ah cruel compassion and
revengeful piety! that made thee a more barbarous enemy to
Pompey, dead than living.&nbsp; Oh that ever two hypocrite eyes
should creep into the first head of the world!&nbsp; To conclude,
the death of C&aelig;sar <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>had been the recovery of our
republic, if the multitude had not called in others of his race
to the government, which rendered thy fall the very hydra of the
empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had had another skirmish upon these words, if Lucifer had
not commanded C&aelig;sar to his cell again, upon pain of death;
and there to abide such correction as belonged to him, for
slighting the warnings he had of his disaster.&nbsp; Brutus and
Cassius too were turned over to the politic fools: and the
senators were dispatched away to Minos and Rhadamanthus, and to
sit as assistants in the devils&rsquo; bench.</p>
<p>After this I heard a murmuring noise, as of people talking at
a distance, and by degrees I made it out that they were wrangling
and disputing still louder and louder, till at length it was but
a word and a blow, and the nearer I came the greater was the
clamour.&nbsp; This made me mend my pace; but before I could
reach them, they were all together by the ears in a bloody fray:
they were persons of great quality all of them, as emperors,
magistrates, generals of armies.&nbsp; Lucifer, to take up the
quarrel, commanded them peace and silence, and they all obeyed,
but it vexed them to the hearts to be so <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>taken off
in the full career of their fury and revenge.&nbsp; The first
that opened his mouth was a fellow so martyred with wounds and
scars, that I took him at first for an indigent officer; but it
proved to be Clitus (as he said himself).&nbsp; And one at his
elbow told him, he was a saucy companion, for presuming to speak
before his time; and so desired audience of Lucifer, for the high
and mighty Alexander, the son of Jupiter, and the emperor and
terror of the world: he was going on with his qualities and
titles; but an officer gave the word, Silence, and bade Clitus
begin; which he took very kindly, and told his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it may please your Majesty,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I
was the first favourite of this emperor, who was then lord of all
the known world, bare the title of the King of Kings, and boasted
himself for the son of Jupiter Hammon; and yet after all this
glory and conquest, he was himself a slave to his passions: he
was rash and cruel, and consequently incapable either of counsel
or friendship.&nbsp; While I lived I was near him, and served him
faithfully; but it seems he did not entertain me so much for my
fidelity as to augment the number of his flatterers; but I found
<a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>myself
too honest for a base office; and still as he ran into any foul
excesses, I took a freedom, with all possible modesty, to show
him his mistakes.&nbsp; One day, as he was talking slightly of
his father Philip (that brave prince, from whom he received as
well his honour as his being) I told him frankly what I thought
of that ingratitude and vanity, and desired him to treat his dead
father with more reverence, as a prince worthy of eternal honour
and respect.&nbsp; This commendation of Philip so inflamed him,
that presently he took a partisan and struck me dead in the place
with his own hand.&nbsp; After this, pray&rsquo;e where was his
divinity, when he gave Abdolominus, (a poor garden-weeder) the
kingdom of Sidonia, which was not, as the world would have it,
out of any consideration of his virtue, but to mortify and take
down the pride and insolence of the Persians.&nbsp; Meeting him
here just now in hell, I asked him what was become of his father
Jupiter now, that he lay so long by&rsquo;t, and whether he were
not yet convinced that all his flatterers were a company of
rascals, who with their incense and altars would persuade him
that he was of divine extraction and heir-apparent to the throne
and thunder of Jupiter.&nbsp; <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>This now was the ground of our
quarrel.&nbsp; But, invectives apart, who but a tyrant would have
put a loyal subject to death, only for his affection and regards
to the memory of his dead father? how barbarously did he treat
his favourites, Parmenio, Philotas, Calisthenes, Amintas, etc.,
so that good or bad is all a case, for &rsquo;tis crime enough to
be the favourite of a tyrant; as, in the course of human life,
every man dies because he is mortal, and the disease is rather
the pretext of his death than the cause of it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You find now,&rdquo; says Satan, &ldquo;that tyrants will
show their people many a dog trick, when the humour takes
them.&nbsp; The good they hate, for not being wicked; and the
bad, because they are no worse.&nbsp; How many favourites have
you ever seen come to a fair and timely end?&nbsp; Remember the
emblem of the sponge, and that&rsquo;s the use that princes make
of their favourites: they let them suck and fill, and then
squeeze them for their own profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that word there was heard a lamentable cry, and at the same
time a venerable old man, as pale as if he had no blood in his
veins, came up to Lucifer, and told him that his emblem of the
sponge came very pat to his case; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;I <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>was a great favourite, and a great hoarder of treasure,
a Spaniard by birth, the tutor and confidant of Nero, and my name
is Seneca.&nbsp; Indeed his bounties were to excess, he gave me
without asking, and in taking I was never covetous but
obedient.&nbsp; It is in the nature of princes, and it befits
their quality, to be liberal where they take a liking, both of
honour and fortunes; and &rsquo;tis hard for a subject to refuse,
without some reflection upon the generosity or discretion of his
master.&nbsp; For &rsquo;tis not the merit or modesty of the
vassal, but the glory of the prince that is in question; and he
is the best subject that contributes the most to the splendour
and reputation of his sovereign.&nbsp; Nero indeed gave me as
much as such a prince could bestow, and I managed his
liberalities with all the moderation imaginable; yet all too
little to preserve me from the strokes of envious and malicious
tongues, which would have it, that my philosophising upon the
contempt of the world was nothing else but a mere imposture, that
with less danger and notice I might feed and entertain my
avarice, and with the fewer competitors.&nbsp; Finding my credit
with my master declining, it stood me upon to provide some way or
other for my <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>quiet, and to withdraw myself from being the mark of a
public envy.&nbsp; So I went directly to Nero, and with all
possible respect and humility made him a present back again of
his own bounties.&nbsp; The truth is, I had so great a passion
for his service, that neither the severity of his nature nor the
debauchery of his manners could ever deter me from exhorting him
to nobler courses, and paying him all the duties of a loyal
subject.&nbsp; Especially in cases of cruelty and blood, I laid
it perpetually home to his conscience, but all to little purpose;
for he put his mother to death, laid the city of Rome in ashes,
and indeed depopulated the empire of honest men.&nbsp; And this
drew on Piso&rsquo;s conspiracy, which was better laid than
executed; for upon the discovery, the prime instruments lost
their lives; and by Divine Providence this prince was preserved,
in order (as one would have thought) to his repentance and change
of life.&nbsp; But upon the issue the conspiracy was prevented,
and Nero never the better.&nbsp; At the same time he put Lucan to
death, only for being a better poet than himself.&nbsp; And if he
gave me my choice what death to die, it was rather cruelty than
pity; for in the very deliberation which death to choose, I
suffered all <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>even in the terror and apprehension that made me refuse
the rest.&nbsp; The election I made was to bleed to death in a
bath, and I finished my own dispatches hither; where, to my
further affliction, I have again encountered this infamous
prince, studying new cruelties and instructing the very devils
themselves in the art of tormenting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that word Nero advanced, with his ill-favoured face and
shrill voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is very well,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;for a prince&rsquo;s favourite or tutor to be wiser than
his master; but let him manage that advantage then with respect,
and not like a rash and insolent fool make proclamation presently
to the world, that he&rsquo;s the wiser of the two.&nbsp; While
Seneca kept himself within those bounds, I lodged him in my
bosom, and the love I had for that man was the glory of my
government; but when he came to publish once (what he should have
dissembled or concealed) that it was not Nero but Seneca that
ruled the empire, nothing less than his blood could make
satisfaction for so intolerable a scandal, and from that hour I
resolved his ruin.&nbsp; And I had rather suffer what I do a
hundred times over than entertain a favourite that should raise
his credit upon my dishonour.&nbsp; Whether I have reason on my
side or no, I <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>appeal to all this princely assembly: draw near, I
beseech ye, as many as are here, and speak freely, my royal
brethren, Did ye ever suffer any favourite to escape unpunished,
that had the impudence to write [I and my king] to make a stale
of majesty, and to publish himself a better statesman than his
master?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; they cried out all
with one voice, &ldquo;it never was, and never shall be endured,
while the world lasts: for we have left our successors under an
oath to have a care on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, a wise
counsellor at a prince&rsquo;s elbow is a treasure, and ought to
be so esteemed while he makes it his business to cry up the
abilities and justice of his sovereign; but in the instant that
his vanity transports him to the contrary, away with him to the
dogs, and down with him, for there&rsquo;s no enduring of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this,&rdquo; cried Sejanus, &ldquo;does not yet
concern me; for though I had indeed more brains than Tiberius,
yet I so ordered it that he had the credit in public of all my
private advices.&nbsp; And so sensible he was of my services,
that he made me his partner and companion in the empire; he
caused my statues to be erected, and invested them with sacred
privileges.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let Sejanus live,&rsquo; was the daily
cry of the <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>people; and in truth, my well-being was the joy of the
empire; and far and near there were public prayers and vows
offered up for my health.&nbsp; But what was the end of
all?&nbsp; When I thought myself surest in my master&rsquo;s arms
and favour, he let me fall, nay he threw me down, caused me to be
cut in pieces, delivering me up to the fury of a barbarous and
enraged multitude, that dragged me along the streets, and happy
was he that could get a piece of my flesh to carry upon a
javelin&rsquo;s point in triumph.&nbsp; And it had been well if
this inhuman cruelty had stopped here; but it extended to my poor
children, who, though unconcerned in my crimes, were yet to
partake in my fate.&nbsp; A daughter I had, whom the very law
exempted from the stroke of justice, because of her virginity;
but to clear that scruple, she was condemned first to be ravished
by the hangman, and then to be beheaded, and treated as her
father.&nbsp; My first failing was upon temerity and pride: I
would outrun my destiny, defy fortune; and for Divine Providence
I looked upon it as a ridiculous thing.&nbsp; When I was once out
of the way, I thought doing worse was somewhat in order to being
better; and then I began to fortify myself by violence, against
craft and malice.&nbsp; <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>Some were put to death, others
banished, till, in fine, all the powers of heaven and earth
declared themselves against me.&nbsp; I had recourse to all sorts
of ill people and means.&nbsp; I had my physician for poisoning,
my assassins for revenge; I had my false witnesses and corrupt
judges; and, in truth, what instruments of wickedness had I
not?&nbsp; And all this, not upon choice or inclination, but
purely out of the necessity of my condition.&nbsp; Whenever I
should come to fall, I was sure to be forsaken both of good and
bad; and therefore I shunned the better sort, as those that would
only serve to accuse me; but the lewd and vicious I frequented,
to increase the number of my complices, and make my party the
stronger.&nbsp; But, after all, if Tiberius was a tyrant,
I&rsquo;ll swear he was never so by my advice; but, on the
contrary, I have suffered more from him for plain dealing and
dissuading him, than the very subjects of his severity have
commonly suffered by him.&nbsp; I know, &rsquo;tis charged upon
me, that I stirred him up to cruelty, to render him odious, and
to ingratiate myself to the people.&nbsp; But who was his
adviser, I pray &rsquo;e, in this butcherly proceeding against
me?&nbsp; Oh Lucifer, Lucifer! you know very well that &rsquo;tis
the practice of tyrants, when they do amiss <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>themselves,
and set their people a-grumbling, to lay all the blame (and
punishment too) upon the instrument; and hang up the minister for
the master&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is the end of all
favourites,&rsquo; cries one; &lsquo;Not a halfpenny matter if
they were all served so,&rsquo; says another.&nbsp; And every
historian has his saying upon this catastrophe, and sets up a
buoy to warn after-ages of the rock of court favours.&nbsp; The
greatness of a favourite, I must confess, proclaims the greatness
of his maker; and the prince that maintains what he has once
raised does but justify the prudence of his own choice; and
whenever he comes to undo what he has done, publishes himself to
be light and unconstant, and does as good as declare himself
(even against himself) of the enemy&rsquo;s party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up stepped Plaintain then, (Severus his favourite) he that was
tossed out of a garret window to make the people sport.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My condition in the world,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;was
perfectly like that of a rocket or fire-work: I was carried up to
a prodigious height in a moment, and all people&rsquo;s eyes were
upon me, as a star of the first magnitude; but my glory was very
short-lived, and down I fell into obscurity and
ashes.&rdquo;&nbsp; After him, appeared a number of other <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>favourites;
and all of them hearkening to Bellisarius the favourite of
Justinian, who, blind as he was, had already knocked twice with
his staff, and shaking his head, with a weak and complaining
voice, desired audience; which was at length granted him, silence
commanded; and he said, as follows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Princes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;before they destroy the
creatures they have raised and chosen, should do well to
consider, that cruelty and inconstancy is much a greater infamy
to a prince than the worst effects of it can be to a
favourite.&nbsp; For my own part, I served an emperor that was
both a Christian and a great lover and promoter of justice.&nbsp;
And yet, after all the services I had done him, in several
battles and adventures, (insomuch that he was effectually become
my debtor, for the very glory of his empire) my reward, in the
end, was to have my eyes put out, and (with a dog and a bell) to
be turned a-begging from door to door.&nbsp; Thus was that
Bellisarius treated, whose very name formerly was worth an army,
and he was the soul of his friends as well as the terror of his
enemies.&nbsp; But a prince&rsquo;s favour is like
quick-silver&mdash;restless and slippery, never to be fixed,
never secured.&nbsp; Force it, and it spends itself in fumes;
sublime <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>it, and &rsquo;tis a mortal poison.&nbsp; Handle it
only, and it works itself into the very bones; and all that have
to do with it, live and die pale and trembling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, the whole band of favourites, set up a hideous
and a heavy groan, trembling like aspen leaves, and at the same
time reciting several passages out of the Prophet Habbakuk,
against careless and wicked governors.&nbsp; By which
threatenings is given to understand, that the Almighty, when He
has a mind to destroy a wicked ruler, does not always punish one
potentate by another, and bring His ends about by a trial of
arms, or the event of a battle; but many times makes use of
things the most abject and vile, to confound the vanity and
arrogance of the mighty; and makes even worms, flies,
caterpillars, and lice to serve Him as the ministers of His
terrible justice; nay, the stone in the wall and the beam in the
house shall rise in judgment against them.</p>
<p>This discourse might have gone further, but that the company
presently parted, to know the meaning of a sudden noise and
clatter they heard, that half-deafened the auditory.&nbsp; And
what was it at last? but a scuffle between the Gown-men and the
Brothers of the Blade; and there were <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>persons of great honour and
learning, young and old, engaged in the fray; the men of war were
at it dashing with their swords, and the gentlemen of the long
robe, fencing, some with tostatus, others with huge pandects,
that with their old wainscot covers were as good as bucklers, and
would now and then give the foe a heavy rebuke, over and
above.&nbsp; The combat had certainly been very bloody, if one of
Lucifer&rsquo;s constables had not commanded them in the
king&rsquo;s name to keep the peace; which made it a drawn
battle.&nbsp; And with that, one of the combatants, with the best
face he had, said aloud, &ldquo;If ye knew, gentlemen, either us,
or our quarrel, you&rsquo;d say we had reason, and perhaps side
with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that instant, there appeared Domitian,
Commodus, Caracalla, Phalaris, Heliogabalus, Alcetes, Andronicus,
Busiris, and old Oliver, with a world of great personages more;
which, when Lucifer saw, he disposed himself to treat that
majestical appearance, as much to their satisfaction as was
possible.&nbsp; And then came up a grave ancient man, with a
great train at his heels, that were all bloody, and full of the
marks they had received under the persecution of these
tyrants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have here before ye,&rdquo; quoth the <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>old man,
&ldquo;Solon; and these are the seven sages, native of Greece,
but renowned throughout the universe.&nbsp; He there in the
mortar is that Anaxarchus that was pounded to death by command of
Nicocreon.&nbsp; He with the flat nose is Socrates; the little
crump-shouldered wretch was the famous Aristotle; and
t&rsquo;other there, the divine Plato.&nbsp; Those in the corner
are all of the same profession too, grave and learned
philosophers, that have displeased tyrants with their writings;
and, in fine, the world is stored with their works and hell with
the authors.&nbsp; To come to the point, most mighty Lucifer, we
are all of us dealers in politics, great writers and deep-read
men in the maxims of State and Government.&nbsp; We have digested
policy into a method, and laid down certain rules, by which
princes may make themselves great and beloved.&nbsp; We have
advised them impartially to administer justice; to reward virtue,
as well military as civil; to employ able men, banish flatterers;
to put men of wisdom and integrity in places of trust; to reward
or punish without passion, and according to the merits of the
cause, as God&rsquo;s vice-gerents.&nbsp; And this now is our
offence.&nbsp; We name no body, we design no body; but &rsquo;tis
crime enough to wish <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>well to the way and to the lovers of
virtue.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that, turning toward the tyrants.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh most unjust princes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;those
glorious kings and emperors from whom we took the model of our
laws and instructions are now in a state of rest and comfort,
while you are tormented.&nbsp; Numa is now a star in the
firmament and Tarquin a fire-brand in hell.&nbsp; And the memory
of Augustus and Trajan is still fresh and fragrant, when the
names of Nero and Sardanapalus are more putrid and odious than
their bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dionysius the tyrant heard this, (with his companions
about him) flesh and blood could hold no longer; and he cried out
in a rage, &ldquo;That roguy philosopher has told a thousand
lies.&nbsp; Legislators, with a pox?&nbsp; Yes, yes, they are
sweet legislators, and princes have many a fair obligation to
them.&nbsp; No, no, sirrah,&rdquo; says he to Solon, &ldquo;you
are all of you a company of quacks; ye prate and speculate of
things ye don&rsquo;t understand; and with your damned moralities
set the people agog upon liberty, cry up the doctrine of
free-born subjects, and then our portion is persecution in one
world and infamy in t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have a fine time on&rsquo;t, my most gracious
prince,&rdquo; cried Julian the <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>apostate, staring Lucifer in the
face, &ldquo;when these dunghill pedants, a company of
cock-brained, ridiculous, mortified, ill-bred, beggarly
tatterdemalions, shall come to erect a committee for politics,
and pass sentence upon governors and governments; stiling
themselves (forsooth) the supporters of both, without any more
skill than my horse in what belongs to either.&nbsp; Tell
me,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if a brave prince had not better be
damned than subject himself to hear one of these
turdy-facy-paty-nasty lowsie-fartical rascals, with a scabbed
head and a plantation of lice in his beard, and his eyes crept
into the nape of his neck, pronouncing, for an aphorism, that a
prince that looks only to one is a tyrant, and that a true king
is the shepherd and servant of his people.&nbsp; Ah, rash and
besotted coxcombs!&nbsp; If a king looks only to others, who
shall look to him?&nbsp; As if princes had not enemies enough
abroad, without being so to themselves too.&nbsp; But you may
write your hearts out, and never the nearer.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
our sovereignty? if we have not our subjects&rsquo; lives and
estates at our mercy.&nbsp; And where&rsquo;s our absolute power?
if we submit to the counsels of our vassals.&nbsp; If we have not
to satisfy our appetites, avarice and revenge, we want power to
discharge <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>the noblest ends of government.&nbsp; These
contemplative idiots would have us make choice of good officers,
to keep the bad in order; which were a madness, in our
condition.&nbsp; Let them be complaisant, and no matter for any
other merit or virtue.&nbsp; A parcel of good offices, handsomely
disposed among a pack of cheats and atheists, will make us a
party another day; whereas all is lost that&rsquo;s bestowed upon
honest men, for they&rsquo;re our enemies; speak truth then all
of ye, and shame the devil; for the butcher fats his sheep only
for the shambles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said enough, I suppose, to stop your mouths, but
here&rsquo;s an orator will read you another-gates lecture of
politics than any you have had yet, if you&rsquo;ll give him the
hearing.&nbsp; Photinus, advance,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;and
speak your mind;&rdquo; whereupon there appeared a brazen-faced
fellow, with a hanging look and twenty other marks of a desperate
villain who, with a hellish yell, and three or four wry mouths
for a prologue, brake into his discourse.</p>
<p>The wicked advice of one of Ptolomy&rsquo;s courtiers, about
the killing of Pompey: taken out of Lucan&rsquo;s
<i>Pharsalia</i>, Lib. 8.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks, under favour (most renowned <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>Ptolomy) we
are now slipped into a debate, a little beside the
business.&nbsp; The question is whether Pompey should be
delivered up to C&aelig;sar, or no.&nbsp; That is to say, whether
in reason of state it ought to be done; and we are formalising
the matter, whether in point of equity and justice it may be
done.&nbsp; Bodies politic have no souls, and never did any great
prince turn a council of state into a court of conscience, but he
repented it.&nbsp; Kingdoms are to be governed by politicians,
not by casuists; and there is nothing more contrary to the true
interest of crowns and empires, than in public cases to make a
scruple of private duties.&nbsp; The argument is this: Pompey is
in distress; and Ptolomy under an obligation, so that it were a
violation of faith and hospitality not to relieve him.&nbsp; Now
give me leave to reason in the other way.&nbsp; Pompey is
forsaken, and persecuted by the Gods; C&aelig;sar upon the heels
of him, with victory and success.&nbsp; Shall Ptolomy now ruin
himself, to protect a fugitive, against both heaven and
C&aelig;sar!&nbsp; I must confess, where honesty and profit are
both of a side, &rsquo;tis well; but, where they disagree, the
prince that does not quit his religion, for his convenience,
falls into a direct conspiracy against himself.&nbsp; <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>He shall
lose the hearts of his soldiery, and the reputation of his
power.&nbsp; Whereas, on the contrary, the most hateful tyrant in
the world shall be able to keep his head above water, let him but
give a general licence to commit all sorts of wickedness;
you&rsquo;ll say &rsquo;tis impious, but I say, what if it be?
who shall call you to account?&nbsp; These deliberations are only
for subjects that are under command, and not for sovereign
princes whose will is a law.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exeat
Aul&acirc;<br />
Qui volet esse pius,</p>
<p>He was never cut out<br />
For a Court, that&rsquo;s devout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In fine, since either Pompey or Ptolomy must suffer, I
am absolutely for the saving of Ptolomy, and the presenting of
Pompey&rsquo;s head, without any more ado, to C&aelig;sar.&nbsp;
A dead dog will never bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Photinus had no sooner made an end, but Domitian appeared in a
monstrous rage, and lugging of poor Suetonius after him like a
bear to the stake.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is not in nature,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;so damned a generation of scribbling rogues as
these historians.&nbsp; We can neither be quiet for them, living
nor dead: for they haunt <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>us in our very graves; and when they
have vented the humour and caprice of their own brains, that
forsooth must be called, The Life of such an Emperor.&nbsp; And,
for an instance, I&rsquo;ll show ye what this impertinent
chronicler says of myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;He had squandered away
his treasure,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;in expensive buildings,
comedies, and donatives to the soldiers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now would I fain know which way it could have been
better employed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In another place, he says, that &lsquo;Domitian had
some thoughts of easing himself in his military charges, by
reducing the number; but that he durst not do, for fear some of
his neighbours should put an affront upon him.&nbsp; So that, to
lick himself whole, he fell to raking and scraping whatever he
could get, either from dead or living; and any rascal&rsquo;s
testimony was proof enough for a confiscation: for there needed
no more to undo an honest man, than to tell a tale at court that
such a one had spoken ill of the prince.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the way of treating majesty? what could this
impudent pedant have said worse, if he had been speaking of a
pick-pocket or a pirate?&nbsp; But princes and thieves are all
one to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says further, that &lsquo;Domitian made <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>seizure of
several estates, without any sort of right whatsoever; and there
went no more to his title than for a false witness to depose that
he heard the defunct declare, before he died, that he made
C&aelig;sar his heir.&nbsp; He set such a tax upon the Jews, that
many of them denied their religion to avoid it; and I remember
that, when I was a young fellow, I saw an old man of fourscore
and ten taken upon suspicion by one of Domitian&rsquo;s spies,
and turned up in a public assembly, to see if he were
circumcised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ye now judges, gentlemen of the Black Guard, if this
be not a most intolerable indignity.&nbsp; Am I to answer for the
actions of my inferior officers?&nbsp; It amazes me that my
successors should ever endure these scandalous reports to be
published, especially against a prince that had laid out so much
money in repairing the libraries that were burnt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very true,&rdquo; said Suetonius in a doleful
tone, &ldquo;and I have not forgotten to make mention of it to
your honour.&nbsp; But what will you say, if I show you, in a
warrant under your hand, this execrable and impious
blasphemy?&nbsp; It is the command of your Lord and God.&nbsp;
And in fine, if I speak nothing but truth, where&rsquo;s your
cause of complaint?&nbsp; I have written <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>the Lives
too of the great Julius C&aelig;sar, and the divine Augustus, and
the world will not say but I have done them right.&nbsp; But for
yourself, and such as you, that are effectually but so many
incarnate and crowned plagues, what fault have I committed in
setting before your eyes those tyrannies, which heaven and earth
cannot but look upon with dread and horror?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This discourse of Suetonius was interrupted by the babbler, or
Boutefeu, that rounded Lucifer in the ear, and told him,
&ldquo;Look ye, sir,&rdquo; says he, pointing with his finger,
&ldquo;that limping devil there, that looks as if he were
surbated with beating the hoof, has been abroad in the world,
this twenty year, and is but just now come back
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come hither, sirrah,&rdquo; cries
Lucifer; and so the poor cur went wriggling and glotting up
toward his prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a fine rogue to be sent
of an errand, are ye not?&rdquo; says Lucifer, &ldquo;to stay
twenty year out, and come back again e&rsquo;en as wise as ye
went: what souls have ye brought now? or what news from
t&rsquo;other world?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! your
highness,&rdquo; quoth the devil, &ldquo;has too much honour and
justice to condemn me unheard.&nbsp; Wherefore be pleased to
remember, that at my going out you gave me charge of a certain
merchant; <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>it cost me the first ten year of my time to make him a
thief, and ten more to keep him from turning honest again, and
restoring what he had stolen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A fine fetch
for a devil this, is it not?&rdquo; cried Lucifer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But hell is no more the hell it was when I knew it first,
than chalk is cheese; and the devils nowadays are so damnedly
insipid and dry, they&rsquo;re hardly worth the roasting.&nbsp; A
senseless puppy to come back to me with a story of
Waltham&rsquo;s calf, that went nine mile to suck a bull.&nbsp;
But he&rsquo;s not master of his trade yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with
that Lucifer bade one of his officers take him away and put him
to school again; &ldquo;for I perceive he&rsquo;s a
rascal,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and he has e&rsquo;en been roguing
at a play-house, when he should have been at church.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In that instant, from behind a little hill, a great many men came
running as hard as they could drive after a company of women: the
men crying out, &ldquo;Stop, stop,&rdquo; and the women crying
for help.&nbsp; Lucifer commanded them all to be seized, and
asked what was the matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo; cried
one of the men, quite out of breath, &ldquo;these carrions have
made us fathers, though we never had children.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Govern your tongue, sirrah,&rdquo; cried a devil of
honour, out of respect to the ladies, &ldquo;and speak <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>truth: for
&rsquo;tis utterly impossible you should be fathers without
children.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the fellow,
&ldquo;we were married men, and honest men and good
house-keepers, and have born offices in the parish, and have
children that call us fathers; but &rsquo;tis a strange thing, we
have been abroad some of us by the seven year together; others,
as long bed-rid; and so impotent, that the civilians would have
put us <i>inter frigidos et maleficiatos</i>: and yet our wives
have brought us every year a child, which we were such fools as
to keep and bring up, and give ourselves to the devil at last to
get them estates; out of a charitable persuasion (forsooth) they
might yet be our own, though for a twelve-month together
(perhaps) we never so much as examined whether our wives were
fish or flesh.&nbsp; But now since the mothers are dead, and the
children grown up, we have found the tools that made them.&nbsp;
One has the coachman&rsquo;s nose, another the
gentleman-usher&rsquo;s legs, a third a cousin-german&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; And some, we are to presume, conceived purely by
strength of imagination, or else by the ears like
weazels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon appeared a little remnant of a man, a dapper
Spaniard, with a kind of a besome-beard, and a voice not unlike
the <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>yapping of a foysting cur.&nbsp; As he came near the
company, he set up his throat, and called out, &ldquo;Ah
jade!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I shall now take ye to task, ye
whore you, for making me father my negro&rsquo;s bastard, and for
the estate I settled upon him.&nbsp; I did ever misdoubt foul
play, but should never have dreamt of that ugly toad, when there
was such choice of handsome, lusty young fellows about us; but it
may be she had them too.&nbsp; I cursed the monks many and many a
time, I remember, to the pit of hell, heaven forgive me
for&rsquo;t; for the strumpet would be perpetually gadding
abroad, under colour of going to confession, and in sooth I was
never any great friend to penance and mortification.&nbsp; And
then would I be easing my mind ever and anon to this cursed
Moor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot imagine,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;where
this mistress of thine should commit all the sins that she goes
every hour of the day to confess at yonder
monastery.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then would this dog-Moor answer
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Alas, good lady! I would e&rsquo;en venture my
soul with hers with all my heart; she spends all her time you see
in holy duties.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was at that time so innocent, that
I suspected nothing more than a pure respect and civility to my
wife; but I have learnt better since, and <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>that
effectually his soul and hers were commonly ventured in the same
bottom; yes, and their bodies too, as I perceive by their magpie
issue, for the bastards take after both father and
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that at this rate,&rdquo; cried the adopted fathers,
&ldquo;the husband of a whore has a pleasant time
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; First, he&rsquo;s subjected to all the pukings,
longings, and peevish importunities, that a breeding woman gives
those about her till she&rsquo;s laid; and then comes the
squalling of the child, and the twittle-twattle-gossipings of the
nurse and midwife, that must be well treated too, well lodged,
and well paid.&nbsp; &lsquo;A sweet baby,&rsquo; says one (to the
jade the mother on&rsquo;t) &lsquo;&rsquo;tis e&rsquo;en as like
the father as if he had spit it out on&rsquo;s mouth; it has the
very lips, the very eyes of him,&rsquo; when &rsquo;tis no more
like him than an apple is like an oyster.&nbsp; And, in
conclusion, when we have borne all this, and twenty times more in
t&rsquo;other world with a Christian patience, we are hurried
away to hell, and here we lie a company of damned cuckolds of us;
and here we are like to lie, for ought I see, in <i>s&aelig;cula
s&aelig;culorum</i>: which is very hard, and in truth out of all
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cut this visit short, to see what news in a deep vault near
at hand, where we <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>heard a great bustle and contest betwixt divers souls
and the devils.&nbsp; There were the presumptuous, the
revengeful, and the envious, gaping and crying out as they would
break their hearts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, that I could but be born
again!&rdquo; says one; &ldquo;Oh, that I might back into the
world again!&rdquo; says another; &ldquo;Oh, that I were but to
die once more!&rdquo; cries a third.&nbsp; Insomuch that they put
the devils out of all patience, with their impertinent and
unprofitable wishes and exclamations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hang
yourselves,&rdquo; cried they, &ldquo;for a pack of cozening,
bawling rascals: you live again? and be born again? and what if
you might do&rsquo;t a thousand times over?&nbsp; You would only
die at last a thousand times greater villains than now you are,
and there would be no clearing hell of you with a dog-whip.&nbsp;
However, to try you and make you know yourselves, we have
commission to let you live again and return.&nbsp; Up then ye
varlets, go, be born again; get ye into the world again.&nbsp;
Away,&rdquo; cried the devils, with a lusty lash at every word,
and thrust hard to have got them out.&nbsp; But the poor rogues
hung an arse, and were struck with such a terror, to hear of
living again, and returning, that they slunk into a corner, and
lay as quiet upon&rsquo;t, as lambs.</p>
<p><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>At
length, one of the company that seemed to have somewhat more
brain and resolution than his fellows, entered very gravely upon
the debate, whether they should go out or no.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I
should now,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;at my second birth, come into
the world a bastard, the shame would be mine, though my parents
committed the fault; and I should carry the scandal and the
infamy of it to my grave.&nbsp; Now put case, my mother should be
honest, (for that&rsquo;s not impossible) and that I came into
the world, legitimate; how many follies, vices, and diseases are
there that run in a blood!&nbsp; Who knows, but I should be mad,
or simple? swear, lie, cheat, whore; nay if I came off, with a
little mortification of my carcase, as the stone, the scurvy, or
the noble pox, I were a happy man.&nbsp; But oh the lodging, the
diet, and the cookery that I am to expect for a matter of nine
months in my mother&rsquo;s belly; and then the butter and beer
that must be spent to sweeten me, when I change my quarter.&nbsp;
I must come crying into the world, and live in ignorance even of
what life is till I die; and then as ignorant of death too, till
&rsquo;tis passed.&nbsp; I fancy my swaddling-clouts and blankets
to be worse than my winding-sheet; my cradle represents my
tomb.&nbsp; And then who <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>knows, whether my nurse shall be
found, or no?&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll over-lay me perhaps; leave me
some four and twenty hours, it may be, without clean clouts, and
a pin or two all the while, perchance, up to the hilts in my
backside.&nbsp; And then follows breeding of teeth, and worms;
with all the gripes and disorders that are caused by unwholesome
milk.&nbsp; These miseries are certain, and why should I run them
over again?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it happen that I pass the state of infancy, without
the pox or measles, I must be then packed away to school, to get
the itch, a scaled head, or a pair of kibed heels.&nbsp; In
winter, &rsquo;tis ten to one you find me with a snotty nose, and
perpetually under the lash, if I either miss my lesson or go late
to school.&nbsp; So that hang him, for my part, that would be
born again, for any thing I see yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I come up toward man, the women will have me as
sure as a gun, for they have a thousand ginnes and devices to
catch wood-cocks; and if ever I come to set eye upon a lass that
understands dress and raillery, I&rsquo;m gone, if there were no
more lads in Christendom.&nbsp; But, for my part, I am as sick as
a dog, of powdering, curling, and playing the ladybird.&nbsp; I
would not for all the world be in <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>the shoemaker&rsquo;s stocks, and
choke myself over again in a straight doublet, only to have the
ladies say, &lsquo;Look, what a delicate shape and foot that
gentleman has.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I would take as little pleasure
to spend six hours, of the four and twenty, in picking grey hairs
out of my head or beard, or turning white into black.&nbsp; To
stand half ravished in the contemplation of my own shadow; to
dress fine, and go to church only to see handsome ladies; to
correct the midnight air with ardent sighs and ejaculations; and
to keep company with owls and bats, like a bird of evil omen; to
walk the round of a mistress&rsquo; lodging, and play at bo-peep
at the corner of every street; to adore her imperfections, (or as
the song says, &mdash; for her ugliness, and for her want of
coin); to make bracelets of her locks, and truck a pearl necklace
for a shoestring.&nbsp; At this rate, I say, cursed again and
again be he, for my part, that would live over again so wretched
a life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being come now to write full man, if I have an estate
how many cares, suits, and wrangles go along with it!&nbsp; If I
have none, what murmuring and regret at my misfortunes!&nbsp; By
this time, the sins of my youth are gotten into my bones; I grow
sour and melancholy; nothing pleases <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>me; I curse old age to ten thousand
devils; and the youth which I can never recover in my veins, I
endeavour to fetch out of the barbers&rsquo; shops, from
perruques, razors, and patches, to conceal, or at least disguise
all the marks and evidences of Nature in her decay.&nbsp; Nay,
when I shall have never an eye to see with nor a tooth left in my
head, gouty legs, wind-mills in my crown, my nose running like a
tap, and gravel in my reins by the bushel, then must I make oath
that all this is nothing but mere accident, gotten by lying in
the field, or the like, and out-face the truth in the very teeth
of so many undeniable witnesses.&nbsp; There is no plague
comparable to this hypocrisy of the members.&nbsp; To have an old
fop shake his heels, when he&rsquo;s ready to fall to pieces; and
cry, these legs would make a shift yet to play with the best legs
in the company; and then, with a lusty thump on&rsquo;s breast,
fetch ye up a hem, and cry, &lsquo;Sound at heart, boy,&rsquo;
and a thousand other fooleries of the like nature.&nbsp; But all
this is nothing to the misery of an old fellow in love,
especially if he be put to gallant it against a company of young
gamesters.&nbsp; Oh the inward shame and vexation, to see himself
scarce so much as neglected.&nbsp; It happens sometimes that <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>a jolly
lady, for want of better entertainment, may content herself with
one of these reverend fornicators, instead of a whetstone; but
alack, alack! the poor man is weak though willing; and after a
whole night spent in cold and frivolous pretences and excuses,
away he goes with torments of rage and confusion about him, not
to be expressed; and many a heavy curse is sent after him for
keeping a poor lady from her natural rest to so little
purpose.&nbsp; How often must I be put to the blush too, when
every old toast shall be calling me old acquaintance, and telling
me, &lsquo;Oh sir, &rsquo;tis many a fair day since you and I
knew one another first.&nbsp; I think &rsquo;twas in the four and
thirtieth of the Queen, that we were school-fellows.&nbsp; How
the world&rsquo;s altered since!&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; And then must
my head be turned to a <i>memento mori</i>; my flesh dissolved
into rheums; my skin withered and wrinkled; with a staff in my
hand, knocking the earth at every trembling step, as if I called
upon my grave to receive me; walking, like a moving phantosme; my
life little more than a dream; my reins and bladder turned into a
perfect quarry; and the urinal or pisspot my whole study.&nbsp;
My next heir watching, every minute, for the long-looked-for and
happy hour of my <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>departure; and in the meantime, I&rsquo;m become the
physician&rsquo;s revenue, and the surgeon&rsquo;s practice, with
an apothecary&rsquo;s shop in my guts; and every old jade calling
me grandsire.&nbsp; No, no; I&rsquo;ll no more living again, I
thank ye: one hell rather than two mothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now consider the comforts of life, the humours
and the manners.&nbsp; He that would be rich must play the thief
or the cheat; he that would rise in the world must turn parasite,
informer, or projecter.&nbsp; He that marries ventures fair for
the horn, either before or after.&nbsp; There is no valour
without swearing, quarrelling, or hectoring.&nbsp; If ye are
poor, nobody owns ye.&nbsp; If rich, you&rsquo;ll know
nobody.&nbsp; If you die young, &lsquo;What pity it was,&rsquo;
they&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;that he should be cut off thus in his
prime.&rsquo;&nbsp; If old, &lsquo;He was e&rsquo;en past his
best; there&rsquo;s no great miss of him.&rsquo;&nbsp; If you are
religious, and frequent the church and the sacrament,
you&rsquo;re an hypocrite; and without this, you&rsquo;re an
atheist or an heretic.&nbsp; If you are gay and pleasant, you
pass presently for a buffoon; and if pensive and reserved, you
are taken to be sour and censorious.&nbsp; Courtesy is called
colloguing and currying of favour; downright honesty and
plain-dealing is interpreted to be <a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>pride and ill manners.&nbsp; This is
the world; and for all that&rsquo;s in&rsquo;t I would not have
it to go over again.&nbsp; If any of ye, my masters,&rdquo; said
he to his camerades, &ldquo;be of another opinion, hold up your
hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; they cried all
unanimously, &ldquo;no more generation-work, I beseech ye; better
the devils than the midwives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this came a testator, cursing and raving like a bedlam,
that he had made his last will and testament.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah
villein!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for a man to murder himself as I
have done!&nbsp; If I had not sealed, I had not died.&nbsp; Of
all things, next a physician, deliver me from a testament.&nbsp;
It has killed more than the pestilence.&nbsp; Oh miserable
mortals, let the living take warning by the dead, and make no
testaments.&nbsp; It was my hard luck, first to put my life into
the physician&rsquo;s power, and then, by making my will, to sign
the sentence of death upon myself, and my own execution.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Put your soul and your estate in order,&rsquo; says the
doctor, &lsquo;for there&rsquo;s no hope of life;&rsquo; and the
word was no sooner out, but I was so wise and devout (forsooth)
as to fall immediately upon the prologue of my will, with an
<i>In nomine Domini</i>, Amen, etc.&nbsp; And when I came to
dispose of my goods and chattels <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>I pronounced these bloody words (I
would I had been tongue-tied when I did it), &lsquo;I make and
constitute my son, my sole executor.&nbsp; <i>Item</i>, to my
dear wife, I give and bequeath all my plays and romances, and all
the furniture in the rooms upon the second storey.&nbsp; To my
very good friend T. B. my large tankard, for a remembrance.&nbsp;
To my foot-boy Robin, five pound to bind him prentice.&nbsp; To
Betty, that tended me in my sickness, my little caudle-cup.&nbsp;
To Mr. Doctor, my fair table diamond, for his care of me in my
illness.&rsquo;&nbsp; After signing, and sealing, the ink was
scarce dry upon the paper, but methought the earth opened as if
it had been hungry to devour me.&nbsp; My son and my legatees
were presently casting it up, how many hours I might yet hold
out.&nbsp; If I called for the cordial julep, or a little of Dr.
Gilbert&rsquo;s water, my son was taking possession of my estate,
my wife so busy about the beds and hangings that she could not
intend it.&nbsp; The boy and the wench could understand nothing
but about their legacies.&nbsp; My very good friend&rsquo;s mind
was wholly upon his tankard.&nbsp; My kind Dr. I must confess
took occasion, now and then, to handle my pulse, and see whether
the diamond were of the <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>right black water, or no.&nbsp; If I
asked him what I might eat, his answer was, &lsquo;Anything,
anything, e&rsquo;en what you please yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp; At
every groan I fetched, they were calling for their legacies,
which they could not have till I was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I were to begin the world again, I think I
should make another kind of testament.&nbsp; I would say:
&lsquo;A curse upon him that shall have my estate when I am dead,
and may the first bit of bread he eats out on&rsquo;t choke
him.&nbsp; The devil in hell take what I cannot carry away, and
him too, that straggles for&rsquo;t, if he can catch him.&nbsp;
If I die, let my boy Robin have the strappado, three hours a day,
to be duly paid him during life.&nbsp; Let my wife die of the
pip, or the mother (not a halfpenny matter which), but let her
first live long enough to plague the damned doctor, and indite
him for poisoning her poor husband.&rsquo;&nbsp; To speak
sincerely, I can never forgive that dog-leech.&nbsp; Was it not
enough to make me sick when I was well, without making me dead
when I was sick?&nbsp; And not to rest there neither, but to
persecute me in my grave too.&nbsp; But, to say the truth, this
is only neighbours&rsquo; fare; for all those fools that trust in
them are served with the same sauce.&nbsp; A vomit or <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>a purge is
as good a passport into the other world as a man would
wish.&nbsp; And then, when our heads are laid, &rsquo;tis never
to be endured the scandals they cast upon our bodies and
memories! &lsquo;Heaven rest his soul,&rsquo; cries one,
&lsquo;he killed himself with a debauch.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How
is&rsquo;t possible,&rsquo; says another, &lsquo;to cure a man
that keeps no diet?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a madman,&rsquo;
cries a third, &lsquo;a mere sot, and would not be governed by
his physician.&nbsp; His body was as rotten as a pear, he had as
many diseases as a horse, and it was not in the power of man to
save him.&nbsp; And truly &rsquo;twas well that his hour was
come, for he had better a great deal die well than live on as he
did.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thieves and murtherers that ye are, you
yourselves are that hour ye talk of.&nbsp; The physician is only
death in a disguise, and brings his patient&rsquo;s hour along
with him.&nbsp; Cruel people!&nbsp; Is it not enough to take away
a man&rsquo;s life, and like common hangmen to be paid
for&rsquo;t when ye have done, but you must blast the honour too
of those you have dispatched, to excuse your ignorance?&nbsp; Let
but the living follow my counsel, and write their testaments
after this copy, they shall live long and happily, and not go out
of the world at last like a rat with a <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>straw in
his arse (as a learned author has it) or be cut off in the flower
of their days, by these counterfeit doctors of the faculty of the
close-stool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dead man plied his discourse with so much gravity and
earnestness, that Lucifer began to believe what he said.&nbsp;
But because all truths are not to be spoken, especially among the
devils, where hardly any are admitted; and for fear of mischief,
if the doctors should come to hear what had been said, Lucifer
presently ordered the fellow to be gagged, or put in security for
his good behaviour.</p>
<p>His mouth was no sooner stopped but another was opened; and
one of the damned came running cross the company, and so up and
down, back and forward (like a cur that had lost his master)
bawling as if he had been out of his wits, and crying out,
&ldquo;Oh! where am I?&nbsp; Where am I?&nbsp; I am abused, I am
choused; what&rsquo;s the meaning of all this?&nbsp; Here are
damning devils, tempting devils, and tormenting devils, but the
devil a devil can I find of the devils that brought me hither;
they have gotten away my devils; where are they?&nbsp; Give me my
devils again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might well make the company stare, <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>to see a
fellow hunting for devils in hell, where they swarm in
legions.&nbsp; But as he was in this hurry, a gouvernante caught
him by the arm, and gave him a half turn and stopped him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Old lucky-bird,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;if thou wantest
devils here, where dost expect to find them?&rdquo;&nbsp; He knew
her as soon as he saw her.&nbsp; And &ldquo;Art thou here old
Beelzebub in a petticoat?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the very picture
of Satan, the coupler of male and female, the buckle and thong of
lechery, the multiplier of sin and the guide of sinners, the
seasoner of rotten mutton, the interpretress betwixt whores and
knaves, the preface to the remedy of love, and the prologue to
the critical minute.&nbsp; Speak, and without more ado, tell me,
where are the devils and their dams that brought me hither?&nbsp;
These are none of them.&nbsp; No, no; I am not such an awfe as to
be trepanned and spirited away by devils with tails, horns,
bristles, wings, that smell as if they had been smoked in a
chimney-corner.&nbsp; The devils that I look for are worse than
these.&nbsp; Where are the mothers that play the bawds to their
own daughters? and the aunts that do as much for their nieces,
and make them caper and sparkle like wild-fire?&nbsp; The
black-eyed girls that carry fire in their eyes, and <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>strike as
sure as a lance from the rest of a cavalier?&nbsp; Where are the
flatterers that speak nothing but pleasing things?&nbsp; The
make-bates and incendiaries, that are the very canker of human
society?&nbsp; Where are the story-mongers?&nbsp; The masters of
the faculty of lying? that report more than they hear, affirm
more than they know, and swear more than they believe.&nbsp;
Those slanderous backbiters, that like vultures prey only upon
carrion?&nbsp; Where are the hypocrites that turn devotion into
interest, and make a revenue of a commandment?&nbsp; That pretend
ecstasy when they are drunk, and utter the fumes and dreams of
their luxury and tipple for revelations?&nbsp; That make chapels
of their parlours, preachments of their ordinary entertainments,
and everything they do is a miracle.&nbsp; They can divine all
that&rsquo;s told them, and raise people to life again; that
counterfeit sick, when they should work, and give an honest man
to the devil with a <i>Deo gratias</i>.&nbsp; These are the
devils I would be at; these are they that have damned me; look
them out, and find them for me, ye impudent hag, or I shall be so
bold as to search your French hood for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
with that word he fell on upon the poor gouvernante, tore off her
head-gear, <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>and laid about him so furiously that there would have
been no getting him off, if Lucifer had not made use of his
absolute authority to quiet him.</p>
<p>Immediately upon the composing of this fray we heard the
shooting of bars and bolts, the opening of doors and hinges that
creaked for want of grease, and a strange humming of a great
number of people.&nbsp; The first that appeared were a company of
bold, talkative, and painted old women; but as bonny and
gamesome, tickling and toying with one another, as if they had
never seen thirteen; and carrying it out with an air of much
satisfaction and content.&nbsp; The babbler was somewhat
scandalised at their behaviour, and told them how ill they did to
be merry in hell; and several others admired it as much, and
asked them the reason of it, considering their condition.&nbsp;
With that one of the gang, that was wretchedly thin and pale, and
raised upon a pair of heels that made her legs longer than her
body, told Lucifer, with great respect, that at their first
coming they were as sad as it was possible for a company of
damned old jades to be.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says she,
&ldquo;we were a little comforted when we heard of no other
punishments here, than weeping and gnashing of <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>teeth, and
in some hope to come off upon reasonable terms; for we have not
among us all so much as a drop of moisture in our bodies, nor a
tooth in our heads.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Search them
presently,&rdquo; cried the intermeddler, &ldquo;squeeze the
balls of their eyes, and let their gums be examined, you&rsquo;ll
find snags, stumps, or roots; or enough of somewhat or other
there to spoil the jest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon the scrutiny they were
found so dry that they were good for nothing in the world but to
serve for tinder or matches, and so they were disposed of into
the devils&rsquo; tinder-boxes.</p>
<p>While they were casing up the old women there came on a number
of people of several sorts and qualities, that called out to the
first they saw, &ldquo;Pray&rsquo;e gentlemen,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;before we go any further, will ye direct us to the court
of rewards?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; cried
one of the company, &ldquo;I was afraid we had been in hell, but
since you talk of rewards I hope &rsquo;tis but
purgatory.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; said the whole
multitude, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll quickly find where you
are.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Purgatory!&rdquo; cried the
intermeddler, &ldquo;you have left that up the hill there, upon
the right hand.&nbsp; This is hell, and a place of punishment;
here&rsquo;s no registry of rewards.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we
are <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>mistaken,&rdquo; said he that spake first.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; cried the intermeddler.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
shall hear,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;we were in the Other
world entitled to the order of the squires of the pad, and
borrowed now and then a small sum upon the King&rsquo;s highway;
we understood somewhat too of the cross-bite and the use of the
frail dye.&nbsp; Some of our conscientious and charitable friends
would fain have drawn us off from the course we were in, and, to
give them their due, bestowed a great deal of good counsel upon
us to very little purpose; for we were in a pretty way of
thriving, and had gotten a habit and could not leave it.&nbsp; We
asked them, &lsquo;What would you have us do?&nbsp; Money we have
none, and without it there&rsquo;s no living; should we stay till
it were brought, or came alone?&nbsp; How would ye have a poor
<i>individuum vagum</i> to live? that has neither estate, office,
master, nor friend to maintain him, and is quite out of his
element unless he be either in a tavern, a bawdy-house, or a
gaming ordinary.&nbsp; Now, that&rsquo;s the man that Providence
has appointed to live by his wits.&rsquo;&nbsp; Our advisers saw
there was no good to be done, and went their way, telling us that
in the other world we should meet with our reward.</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>&ldquo;They would tell us some time, how base a thing
it was to defame the house and abuse the bed of a friend.&nbsp;
Our answer was ready, &lsquo;Well! and had we not better do it
there where the house is open to us, the master and lady kind,
the occasion fair and easy, than to run a caterwauling into a
family where every servant in the house is a spy, and (perhaps) a
fellow behind every door in the house with a dagger or pistol in
his hand to entertain us.&rsquo;&nbsp; Upon this, our grave
counsellors finding us so resolute, e&rsquo;en gave us over, and
told us as before, that in the other world we should meet with
our reward.&nbsp; Now taking this to be the other world these
honest men told us of, we are inquiring after the rewards they
promised us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abominable scoundrels!&rdquo; said an officer of
justice, there at hand, &ldquo;how many of your reprobated
companions have squandered away their fortunes upon whores and
dice, exposing not only their wives and children but many a noble
family to a shameful and irreparable ruin; and let any man put in
a word of wholesome advice, their answer is, &lsquo;Tush, tush;
our wives and children are in the hands of Providence; and let
Him provide for the <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>rooks, that feeds the
ravens.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then was it told ye, you should find your
reward in the other world; and the time is now come wherein ye
shall receive it; up, up then, ye cursed spirits, and away with
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; At which word a legion of devils fell on upon
the miserable caitiffs, with whips and firebrands, and gave them
their long-expected reward; and at every lash a voice was heard
to say, &ldquo;In the other world you shall receive your
reward;&rdquo; these wretches, in the meanwhile, damning and
sinking themselves to the pit of hell, still, as if they had been
upon earth, and vomiting their customary and execrable
blasphemies.</p>
<p>Just as this storm blew over there drew near a multitude of
bailiffs, sergeants, Catchpoles, and other officers of prey, with
the thieves&rsquo; devil, bound hand and foot, and a foul
accusation against him.&nbsp; Whereupon Lucifer, with a fell
countenance, took his seat in a flaming chair, and called his
officers about him.&nbsp; So soon as the prince had taken his
place, a certain officer began his report.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is
before thee,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;a devil, most mighty
Lucifer, that stands charged with ignorance in his trade; and the
shame of his quality and profession, instead of damning men, he
has made it his <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>business to save them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The word save put
the court in such a rage, that they bit their lips till the blood
started and the fire sparkled at their eyes; and Lucifer, turning
about to his attorney, &ldquo;Who would ever have
imagined,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that so treacherous a rascal
could have been harboured in my dominions?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is most certain, my gracious lord,&rdquo; replied the attorney,
&ldquo;that this devil has been very diligent in drawing people
into thefts and pilferies, and then, when they come to be
discovered, they are clapped up and hanged, or some mischief or
other.&nbsp; But still, before execution, the ordinary calls them
to shrift; and many times the toy takes them in the head to
confess and repent, and so they are saved.&nbsp; Now this silly
devil thinks, that when he has brought them to steal, murder,
coin, and the like, he has done his part, and so he leaves them;
whereas he should stick close to them in the prison, and be
tempting of them to despair and make away themselves.&nbsp; But
when they are once left to the priest, he commonly brings them to
a sight of their sins, and they &rsquo;scape.&nbsp; Now this
simple devil was not aware, it seems, that many a soul goes to
heaven from the gallows, the wheel, and the faggot: and this
failing has lost your <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>Highness many a fair
purchase.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; cried
the president, &ldquo;and there needs no more charge against
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor devil thought it was high time to
speak now, when they were just upon the point of passing his
sentence; and so he cried out, &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I beseech you hear me; for though they say the devil is
dead, it is not meant of your greatness.&rdquo;&nbsp; So there
was a general silence, and thus he proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot deny, my lord, but Tyburn is the way to
paradise, and many a man goes to heaven from the gallows.&nbsp;
But if you will set those that are damned for condemning others,
against those that are saved from the gallows, hell will be found
no loser by me at the foot of the account.&nbsp; How many
marshal&rsquo;s-men, turn-keys, and keepers have I sent ye for
letting a coiner give them the slip now and then, with his false
money (always provided they leave better money instead
on&rsquo;t).&nbsp; How many false witnesses and knights of the
post, that would set their consciences like clocks to go faster
or slower, according as they had more or less weight, and swear
<i>ex tempore</i>, at all rates and prices!&nbsp; How many
solicitors, attorneys, and clerks, that would draw ye up a
declaration or an indictment, so slyly, that <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>I myself
could hardly discover any error in&rsquo;t; and yet, when it came
to the test, it was as plain as the nose on a man&rsquo;s face
(that is to say again, provided they were well paid for the
fashion).&nbsp; How many jailers that would wink at an escape for
a lusty bribe!&nbsp; And how many attorneys that would give ye
dispatch or delay thereafter, as they were greased!&nbsp; Now,
after all this, what does it signify, if one thief of a thousand
comes to the gallows? he only suffers because he was poor, that
there may be the better trading for the rich, and without any
design in the world to suppress stealing.&nbsp; Nay, it often
falls out, that they that bring the malefactor to the gibbet are
the worse criminals of the two.&nbsp; But they are never looked
after; or, if they should be, they have tricks and fetches enough
to bring themselves off; so that it fares in this case, as it did
with him that had his house troubled with rats, and would needs
take in a company of cats to destroy them: the rats would be
nibbling at his cheese, his bacon, a crust of bread, and now and
then a candle&rsquo;s end; but when the cats came, down went a
milk-bowl, away goes a brace of partridges or a couple of
pigeons, and the poor man must content himself to go supperless
to bed.&nbsp; In the conclusion, the rats were troublesome, <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>but the
cats were intolerable.&nbsp; And then there&rsquo;s this
in&rsquo;t: Suppose one poor fellow hangs and goes to heaven: I
do but give him in truck for two hundred, at least, that deserve
to be hanged but &rsquo;scape and go to hell at last.&nbsp;
Beside, a thief upon a gibbet is as good as a roasted dog in a
pigeon house; for ye shall immediately have two or three thousand
witches about him, for snips of his halter, an eye-tooth, or a
collop of his fat, which is of sovereign use in many of their
charms.&nbsp; But, in fine, let me do what I will my services are
not understood.&nbsp; My successor, it may be, will discharge his
duty better, and indeed I am very well content to lay down my
commission; for (to say the truth) I am in years, and would
gladly have a little rest now, in my old age, which I rather
propose to myself in the service of some pretender than where I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucifer heard him with great patience, and, in the end, gave
him all the satisfaction imaginable; strictly charging the evil
spirits that had abused him to do so no more, upon hazard of
pains corporal and spiritual; and they desired him, too, that he
would not lay down his employment, for he was strong enough yet
to do very good service in it.&nbsp; But to think of easing
himself, <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>by going to a pretender, he&rsquo;d find himself
mistaken, for &rsquo;twas a duty he&rsquo;d never be able to
endure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;e&rsquo;en what
your Highness pleases.&nbsp; But truly I thought a devil might
have lived very comfortably in that condition; for he has no more
to do, that I can see, than to keep his ears open, and learn his
trade.&nbsp; For put case it should be some pretender to a good
office, or a fat bishopric (though the fathers and councils are
against pretenders in this case) I fancy to myself all the
pleasure and divertisement that may be.&nbsp; It is as good as
going to school, for these people teach the devils their A B
C.&nbsp; And all that we have to do is to sit still and
learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vision that followed this was the d&aelig;mon of tobacco,
which I must confess did not a little surprise me.&nbsp; I have
indeed often said to myself, &ldquo;Certainly these smokers are
possessed;&rdquo; but I could never swear it till now.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;by bringing this
weed into Spain, revenged the Indians upon the Spaniards for all
the massacres and butcheries they committed there, and done them
more mischief than ever Colon, Cortes, Almero, Pizarro did in the
Indies: by how much it is more honourable to die upon a
sword&rsquo;s point <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>by gunshot, or at the mouth of a
cannon, than for a man to snivel and sneeze himself into another
world; or to go away in a meagrim or a spotted fever, perchance,
which is the ordinary effect of this poisonous tobacco.&nbsp; It
is with tobacconists as &rsquo;tis with demoniacs under an
exorcism, they fume and vapour, but the devil sticks to them
still.&nbsp; Many there are that make a very idol of it; they
admire, they adore it, tempting and persecuting all people to
take it, and the bare mention of it puts them into an
ecstasy.&nbsp; In the smoke it is a probation for hell, where
another day they must endure smoking; taken in powder, at the
nose, it draws upon youth the incommodities of old age, in the
perpetual annoyance of rheum and drivel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The devil of subornation came next, which was a
good-complexioned and a well-timbered devil, to my great
amazement I must acknowledge, for I had never seen any devils
till now but what were extreme ugly.&nbsp; The air of his face
was so familiar to me that methought I had seen it in a thousand
several places; sometime under a veil, sometime open; now under
one shape and then under another.&nbsp; One while he called
himself child&rsquo;s-play; another while, kind entertainment;
here, payment; <a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>there, restitution; and, in a third place, alms: but,
in fine, I could never learn his right name.&nbsp; I remember in
some places I have heard him called inheritance, profit, good
cheap, patrimony, gratitude.&nbsp; Here he was called doctor;
there, bachelor.&nbsp; With the lawyers, solicitors, and
attorneys, he passed under the name of right; and the confessors
called him charity.</p>
<p>He was well accompanied, and styled himself Satan&rsquo;s
lieutenant; but there was a devil of consequence that opposed
him, might and main, and made this proclamation of himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be it known,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that I am the great
embroiler and politic entangler of affairs.&nbsp; The deluder of
princes, the pretext of the unworthy, and the excuse of
tyrants.&nbsp; I can make black, white; and give what colour I
please to the foulest actions in nature.&nbsp; If I had a mind to
overturn the world, and put all in a general confusion, I could
do it; for I have it in my power to banish order and reason out
of it; to turn sauciness and importunity into merit, example into
necessity; to give law to success, authority to infamy, and
credit to insolence.&nbsp; I have the tongues of all counsellors
at my girdle, and they shall speak neither more nor less than
just as I please.&nbsp; In short, that&rsquo;s easy to me which
<a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>others
account impossible, and while I live ye need never fear either
virtue, justice, or good government in the world.&nbsp; This
devil of subornation, that talks of his lieutenancy, what could
he ever have done without me?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a rascal that no
person of quality would admit into his company, if I did not fit
him with vizors and disguises.&nbsp; Let him hold his tongue
then, and know himself; and let me hear no more of those disputes
about the lieutenancy of hell, for I have Lucifer&rsquo;s broad
seal to show for my title to&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; cried another mutinous spirit,
&ldquo;I am one of those humble-minded devils that can content
myself to hold the door, upon a good occasion; or knock under the
table, and play at small game rather than stand out.&nbsp; But
few words among friends are best, and when I have spoken three or
four, let him come up that lists.&nbsp; I am then,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;the devil interpreter, and my business is to gloss
upon the text; in which case, the cuckolds are exceedingly
beholden to me; for I have much to say for the honour of the
horn.&nbsp; How should a poor fellow that has a handsome wench to
his wife, and never a penny to live on, hold up his head in the
world, if it were not for that quality?&nbsp; I have a <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>pretty
faculty in doing good offices for distressed ladies, at a time of
need; and I make the whole sex sensible how great a folly and
madness it is to neglect those sweet opportunities.&nbsp; Among
other secrets, I have found out a way to establish an office for
thievery, where the officers shall be thieves and justify it when
they have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he stopped.</p>
<p>There was a short silence, and then there appeared another
devil of about a foot and a half long.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;a devil but of a small size, and perhaps one of
the least in hell; and yet the door opens to me as well as to
another, for I never come empty handed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
what have you brought them?&rdquo; says the intermeddler, and
came up to him, &ldquo;What have I brought?&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;I have brought an eternal talker and a finical flatterer;
they are two pieces that were in high esteem in the cabinets of
two great princes, and I have brought them for a present to
Lucifer.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that, Lucifer cast his eye upon them,
and with a damned-verjuice-face, as if he had bitten a crab,
&ldquo;You do well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to say ye had them at
court; and I think you should do well to carry them thither
again; for I had as lief have their room as their
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>After
him followed another dwarf devil, complaining that he had been a
matter of six years about so infamous a rascal, that there was no
good to be done with him, for the bad as well as the better sort
were scandalised at his conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;A mighty piece
of business,&rdquo; cried the gouvernante.&nbsp; &ldquo;And could
you not have gotten him a handsome office or employment?&nbsp;
That would have made him good for something, and you might have
done his business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime the babbler went whispering up and down and
finding faults, till at length he came to a huge bundle of
sleeping devils in a corner, that were fagotted up, and all
mouldy and full of cobwebs, which he immediately gave notice of,
and they cut the band to give them air.&nbsp; With much ado they
waked them, and asked what devils they were, what they did there,
and why they were not upon duty.&nbsp; They fell a-yawning, and
said that they were the devils of luxury: &ldquo;But since the
women have taken a fancy to prefer guinies and jacobusses before
their modesty and honour, there has been no need of a devil in
the case to tempt them; for &rsquo;tis but showing them the merry
spankers, they&rsquo;ll dare like larks, and fall down before ye,
and then ye may e&rsquo;en do what you will <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>with them,
and take them up in a purse-net.&nbsp; Gold supplies all
imperfections; it makes an angel of a crocodile, turns a fool
into a philosopher, and a dressing-box well lined is worth twenty
thousand devils.&nbsp; So that there is no temptation like a
present; and take them from top to bottom, the whole race of
woman is frail, and one thread of pearl will do more with them
than a million of fine stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as this devil made an end we heard another snorting; and
&rsquo;twas well he did so, for we had trod upon his belly
else.&nbsp; He was laid hold of, upon suspicion that he slept
dog-sleep, or rather the sleep of a contented cuckold, that would
spoil no sport where he made none.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;the nuns&rsquo; devil, and for want of other
employment I have been three days asleep here as you found
me.&nbsp; My mistresses are now choosing an abbess, and always
when they are at that work I make holiday: for they are all
devils themselves then; there is such canvassing, flattering,
importuning, cajoling, making of parties; and in a word so
general a confusion, that a devil among them would do more hurt
than good.&nbsp; Nay, the ambitious make it a point of honour
upon such an occasion, to show that they can out-wit the
devils.&nbsp; And if <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>ever hell should be in danger of a
peace, it is my advice that you presently call in a convention of
nuns to the election of an abbess, which would most certainly
reduce it to its ancient state of sedition, mutiny, and
confusion, and bring us all in effect to such a pass that we
should hardly know one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucifer was very well pleased with the advice, and ordered it
to be entered upon the register, as a sure expedient to suppress
any disorders that might happen for the future to the disturbance
of his government: after which he commanded the issuing out of a
summons to all his companies and livery-men, who forthwith
appeared in prodigious multitudes; and Lucifer with a hideous
yell delivered himself most graciously as follows.</p>
<h3>THE DECREE OF LUCIFER</h3>
<p>&ldquo;To our trusty and despairing legions, and well-beloved
subjects, lying under the condemnation of perpetual darkness,
that lived pensioners to sin, and had death for their pay-master,
greeting.&nbsp; This is to let you understand, that there are two
devils, who pretend a claim to the honour <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>of our
lieutenancy; but we have absolutely refused to gratify either the
one or the other, in that point, out of a singular affection and
respect to our right trusty and well-beloved cousin, a certain
she-devil that deserves it before all others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the whole assembly fell to whispering and muttering,
and staring one upon another, till at last Lucifer observing it
bade them never trouble themselves to guess who it might be, but
fetch good fortune to him, known otherwise by the name of Madam
Prosperity, who presently appeared in the tail of the assembly,
and with a proud and disdainful air marched up and planted
herself before the degraded seraphim, who looked her wistly in
the face, and then he on in the tone he first began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our will, pleasure, and command, that next and
immediately under our proper person, you pay all honour and
respect to the Lady Prosperity, and obey her, as the most mighty
and supreme governess of these our dominions.&nbsp; Which titles
and qualities we have conferred upon her, as due to her merit;
for she hath damned more souls than all you together.&nbsp; She
it is that makes men cast off all fear of God and love of their
neighbour.&nbsp; She it is <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>that makes men place their sovereign
good in riches; that engages and entangles men&rsquo;s minds in
vanity; strikes them blind in their pleasures; loads them with
treasure, and buries them in sin.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the tragedy
that she has not played her part in&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
the stability and wisdom that she has not staggered?&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s the folly that she has not improved and
augmented?&nbsp; She takes no counsel and fears no
punishment.&nbsp; She it is that furnishes matter for scandal,
experience for story, that entertains the cruelty of tyrants, and
bathes the executioners in innocent blood.&nbsp; How many souls
that lived innocent, while they were poor, have fallen into
impiety and reprobation, so soon as ever they came to drink of
the enchanted cup of prosperity!&nbsp; Go to then, be obedient to
her, we charge ye all, as to ourself; and know, that they that
stand their ground against prosperity are none of your
quarry.&nbsp; Let them e&rsquo;en alone, for &rsquo;tis but time
lost to attempt them.&nbsp; Take example from that impertinent
devil, that got leave to tempt Job; he persecuted him, beggared
him, covered him all over with scabs and ulcers.&nbsp; Sot that
he was! if he had understood his business, he would have gone
another way to work, and begged leave to have multiplied <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>riches upon
him, and to have possessed him of health and pleasures.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the trial; and how many are there that when they
thrive in the world turn their backs upon Heaven, and never so
much as name their Creator, but in oaths, and then too, without
thinking on Him?&nbsp; Their discourse is all of jollities,
banquets, comedies, purchases, and the like.&nbsp; Whereas the
poor man has God perpetually both in his mouth and heart.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;be mindful of me, and have
mercy upon me, for all my trust is in Thee.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Wherefore,&rdquo; says Lucifer, redoubling his accursed clamour,
&ldquo;let it be published forthwith throughout all our
territories, that calamities, troubles, and persecutions are our
mortal enemies, for so we have found them upon experience; they
are the dispensations of Providence, the blessings of the
Almighty, to fit sinners for Himself, and they that suffer them
are enrolled in the militia of heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; For the better administration of our
government, it is our will and pleasure, and we do strictly
charge and command, that our devils give constant attendance in
all courts of judicature; and they are hereby totally discharged
from any further care of little pettifoggers, flatterers, and
envious <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>persons, for they are so well acquainted with hell
road, that they&rsquo;ll guide one another without the help of a
devil to bring them hither.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; We do ordain and command that no devil
presume for the future to entertain any confident, but profit;
for that&rsquo;s the harbinger that provides vice the most
commodious quarter, even in the straitest consciences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; We do ordain, as a matter of great
importance to the conservation of our empire, that in what part
soever of our dominions the devil of money shall vouchsafe to
appear, all other devils there present shall rise, and, with a
low reverence, present him the chair, in token of their
submission to his power and authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; We do most expressly charge and command
all our officers, as well civil as military, to employ their
utmost diligence and industry, for the establishing a general
peace throughout the world.&nbsp; For that&rsquo;s the time for
wickedness to thrive in, and all sorts of vices to prosper and
flourish&mdash;as luxury, gluttony, idleness, lying, slandering,
gaming, and whoring; and, in a word, sin is upon the increase and
goodness in the wane.&nbsp; Whereas in a <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>state of
war, men are upon the exercise of valour and virtue; calling
often upon Heaven, in the morning, for fear of being knocked on
the head after dinner: and honest men and actions are
rewarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; We do from this time forward discharge all
our officers and agents whatsoever, from giving themselves any
further trouble of tempting men and women to sins of
incontinence, for as much as we find, upon experience, that
adultery and fornication will never be left, till the old woman
scratches the stool for her backside.&nbsp; And though there may
be several intervals of repentance, and some faint purposes of
giving it over, yet the humour returns again with the next tide
of blood, and concupiscence is as loyal a subject to us as any we
have in our dominions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; In consideration of the exemption
aforesaid, by which means several poor devils are left without
present employment; and forasmuch as there are many merchants and
tradesmen in London, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, and elsewhere, up
and down the world, that are very charitably disposed to relieve
people in want, especially young heirs newly at age, and
spendthrifts, that come to borrow money of them; but the times
being dead, <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>and little money stirring, all they can do is to
furnish them with what the house affords; and if a hundred pound
or two in commodity will do them any good, &rsquo;tis at their
service (they say).&nbsp; This the gallant takes up at an
excessive rate, to sell again immediately for what he can get;
and the merchant has his friend to take it off underhand, at a
third part of the value (which is the way of helping men in
distress).&nbsp; Now out of a singular respect to the said
merchants and tradesmen, and for their better encouragement, as
also, to the end that the devils aforesaid may not run into lewd
courses for want of business, we will and require that a legion
of the said devils shall from time to time be continually aiding
and assisting to the said merchants and tradesmen, in the quality
of factors, to be relieved monthly by a fresh legion, or oftener
if occasion shall require.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; We will and command that all our devils,
of what degree or quality soever, do henceforth entertain a
strict amity and correspondence with our trusty and well beloved
the usurers, the revengeful, the envious, and all pretenders to
great places and dignities; and, above all others, with the
hypocrites, who are the most <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>powerful impostors in nature, and so
excellently skilled in their trade that they steal away
people&rsquo;s hearts and souls at the eyes and ears insensibly,
and draw to themselves adoration and reward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; We do further order and command, that all
care possible be taken for the maintaining of blabs, informers,
incendiaries, and parasites in all courts and palaces, for thence
comes our harvest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; That the babblers, tale-bearers,
make-bates, and instruments of divorces and quarrels, be no
longer called fanes, but bellows; in regard that they draw and
inflame, without giving any allay or refreshment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Item</i>; That the intermeddlers be hereafter called
and reputed the devils&rsquo; body-lice, because they fetch blood
of those that feed and nourish them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucifer then casting a sour look over his shoulder, and spying
the gouvernante: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of his mind,&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;that said, &lsquo;Let God dispose of the Do&uuml;egnas (or
gouvernantes) as He pleases; for I&rsquo;m in no little trouble
how to dispose of these confounded carrions.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whereupon, the damned cried out, with one voice, &ldquo;Oh,
Lucifer! let it never be said that it rained Do&uuml;egnas in thy
dominions.&nbsp; Are we not <a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>miserable enough without this new
plague of being baited by hags?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! cursed
Lucifer,&rdquo; cried every one to himself, &ldquo;stow them
anywhere, so they come not near me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that,
they all clapped their tails between their legs, and drew in
their horns, for fear of this new torment.&nbsp; Lucifer, finding
how the dread of the old women wrought upon the devils, contented
himself, at the present, to let it pass only <i>in terrorem</i>;
but withal he swore, by the honour of his imperial crown, and as
he hoped to be saved, that what devil devil&rsquo;s dam, or
reprobate soever, should in time to come be found wanting to his
duty and in the least degree disobedient to his laws and
ordinances, all and every the said devil or devils, their dams
and reprobates so offending, should be delivered up to the
torture of the Do&uuml;egna, and tied muzzle to muzzle; so to
remain <i>in s&aelig;cula s&aelig;culorum</i>, without relief or
appeal, or any law, statute, or usage to the contrary
notwithstanding.&nbsp; &ldquo;But in the meantime, cast them into
that dry ditch,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that they may be ready for
use upon any occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately, upon the pronouncing of this solemn decree,
Lucifer retired to his cell, the weather cleared up, and the <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>company
dispersed in a fright, at so horrible a menace, and so went about
their business: when a voice was heard out of the clouds, as the
voice of an angel, saying, &ldquo;He that rightly comprehends the
morality of this discourse, shall never repent the reading of
it.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
